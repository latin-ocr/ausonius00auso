Hughys Clzapel. The sanie defects, narrowness in out-
look and egoism‚ make sterile even those poems which
commemorate keener sorrows than a man of seventy
might be expected to feel at the death of his father
at the ripe age of ninety: a favourite grandson is
accidentally killed, and the cry is not ‘⁶ O the pity of

self-centred to eng-age entire respect. It is in the
verses To his sze (Epigr. xl.) alone that an entirer

drag in the stifflay-figures of Nestor with his “triple
span ’' and Deiphobe of Cumae to chill the atmosphere
of brave optimism and tenderness.

of the schools, and from the schools, he derived both
his subjects and his mode of treatment. The names
of the days of the week, the Roman calendar, tabloid
histories of the Roman Emperors‚ a catalogue of mono-
syllables in Latin, or of the Trojan W'ar heroes—such
