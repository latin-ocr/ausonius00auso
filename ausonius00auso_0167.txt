BonDEAux, MAcfflNUS, SUCURO, CoNcoR010s‚
PHoEmcms, Ammonius„ AND ANASTAsms,
GRAMMARIAN or P01cT1Eus

Now, as the pious homage of my mournful task
shall present each one, Ι will tell of those who,
though of humble birth and rank and merit, in-
stilled into the uncultured minds of the people of
Bordeaux the love of letters.

11 Let Macrinus be named amongst these: to him
I was entrusted first when a boy3 and SucurO,
the freedman's son, temperate and well-suited to
form youthful minds. You too, Concordius, were
another such, you who, fleeing your country, took in
exchange a chair of little profit in a foreign town.
Nor must I leave unmentioned the old man Phoe-
bicius,1 who, though the keeper of Belenus' temple,
got no profit thereby. Yet he, sprung, as rumour
goes, from the stock of the Druids of Armorica
(Brittany), obtained a chair at Bordeaux by his son’s
help : long may his line endure l

35 Ι will sing of Ammonius also—for, indeed, it is
a solemn duty to commemorate a grammarian of my
own native place—who used to teach raw lads their
alphabet:2 he had scant learning and was of an
ungentle nature, and therefore—as was his due—
was held in slight repnte.

¹ cp. Prof. IV. 13. For Belenus see note on id. 1. 9.
² Or perhaps the elements of Latin are meant.

 

is placed between ll. 31 and 32 (whence it was possibly
omitted through homoeoteleuton with l. 32).

For the order of the verses (which is much confused) in
the M S„ see the editions of Peiper or Schenkl.

The latter half of 1. 35 is supplied by the Translator.
