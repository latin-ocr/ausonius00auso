THE ECLOGUES

courts, from these the feuds of the maddened Circus
and the wide—spread partizanship which fills the tiers
of the theatre, from these the debates which occupy
the Senate. Wives, children, fathers, bandy these
two words in peaceful debate without unnatural
quarrelling. They are the instruments with which
the 50110015 fit for peaceful learning wage their harm-
less war of philosophie strife. On them the whole
throng of rhetoricians depends in its wordy contests :
(( You grant that it is light? 1 Yes? Then it is day l ’'

((,Νο the point is not granted3 for whenever many
torches or lightning· flashes give us light by night,
yes, it is light3 but that is not the light of day. '' It 15
a case 01“(( yes' ’and“ no' t'l31en for we are bound to
say: ((Υ65, it is light,'’ and‘ (ΝΟ, it 15 not day.’'
There you have the source of countless squabbles:
that is why some—nay, many—pondering on such
things, smother their gruff protests and bite their
lips in raging silence.

V.—ON THE AoEs oF LIVING THINGS: A FRAGMENT
FnoM HEs10n²

Tanau times two and nine times ten complete the
tale of years whereto the life of men who live to
fulness of old age attains. Nine times the chattering
crow passes this limit in her span of life, while the stag
passes through four times the lifetime of the crow.
Thrice the raven outstrips the swift-footed stag in
length of years; while that bird which renews its life,
the Phoenix, multiplies ninefold the raven’s years.
