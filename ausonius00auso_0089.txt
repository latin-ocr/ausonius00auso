ties, these mild rulers of the earth and instruments
of Heaven, claim them for thine own in presence of
thine eterna] Father, O Christ most merciful.

III.—A PRAYER OF Ausons THE CONSUL
IN RHopmcl Vssnsn:

O Gon, our hope, who dost provide for us an end-
less home3 if we by holy prayer and vigil win thy
pardon, then, Father, in thy mercy grant us our
petitions. Grant us, O Christ, to know thy faultless
pattern, O gracious King, thou quickener of thy
servants who adore thee—thou, who with the F ather,
the Unbegotten, art one Majesty most high. Grant
through the fellowship of the Cornforter a triple
stay to aid us, that throngs of worshippers may
ceaselessly prolong thy praise: to thee it is they
haste fitly to keep vigil. Night shall bring back
a light far beyond any taper’s ray3 night which
sends forth 3 bearn in which believers put their
trust; night which broods o’er the tasks of the fiery
stars. Thou at thy table endest our solemn fasts3
thou, who dost promise still increasing blessings, art
praised by all with one accord: O thou, our Ruler‚
give us poor worthless mortals power to express the
greatness of the Almighty.

16 Thy fount cleanseth the sinner made justified
by new creation: it bringeth the heart forgetful-
ness of sins now laid aside: it causeth thy cleansed
lambs to shine white as the snow. The light,
brought in by the VVord, the sinner's stay, even as 3
new washing clean in Jordan, hath sanctified them,

² Rhopalic (“ clublike '') verse is tha-t in which tho first

word is a monosyllable‚ the second 3 disyllable‚ the third 3
