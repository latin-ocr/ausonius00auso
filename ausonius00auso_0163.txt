THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

VIL-Laoxnus THE GRAMMARMN. SURNAMED
LASCIVUS

Yon who love a glad and cheerful soul, you who
observe festal days with their jests, their prayers,
their shows, forget not to recall year by year the
name of Leontius with a dirge. Enduring to be
called Lascivus (Wanton), though the name was a
libel on his upright life, 116 never forbade its use,
because he knew it amused his friends' ears. In
letters he had attained a high enough degree to
qualify him for his humble chair, and to give him
some claim to be enrolled as a grammarian.

13 You were the constant companion of my youth,
although you bare a heavier load of years, and still
to—day you have a warm place in my heart, kindly
Leontius. I take sad pleasure in the task of honour-
ing your memory with the mournful strain of this
complaint: it is a task unpleasing, but one that my
verse owes to you.
