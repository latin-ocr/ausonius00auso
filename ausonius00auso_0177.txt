THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

alive. Howbeit, with loving care our prince Augustus
restored your body to your native place and to the
tomb of your family. So year by year this day
brings round a cause for tears and this mournful
task of joyless devotion.

XV11.--Exnpmms OF TOULOUSE‚ THE RHETomcmN

Now must 1 renew your memory, Exuperius, an
orator without help of mles, solemn of gait, majestic
in speech, handsome in features and, in a word,
admirable in gesture and deportment. Your elo-
quence was matchless in its fluency, and if judged
only by the ear, would please through mere force of
sound, but if closely examined would be found to
contain no solid thought.1 At first the councillors
of Toulouse, that home of Pallas, received you with
adoration, but soon drove you as lightly away. Then
Narbo harboured you: there, taking a high fee for
your teaching, you trained in rhetoric the sons of
Dalmatius 2—1·0yal but tragic names—from boyhood
up to the beginning of manhood. When in due time
they assumed the title of Caesar, they bestowed
upon you the dignity of a governorship and a tri-
bunal in Spain. Passing away, exceeding rich, you
brought your unruffled nature and your peaceful
years to a close in your abode at Cadurca (Cahors).
But your country's claims and the birthplace of
your family summon you to bequeath your title
of rhetorician to Bordeaux.
