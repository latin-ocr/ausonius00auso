THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

XXII.-—T0 Vlc'romUS, Ass1sTANT-TEACHER on Usum

SCHOLARLY Victorius, gifted with memory and a
quick brain, how patiently you used to pore over
books which no one read, and study only abstruse
lore! You liked better to unroll worm-eaten and
outlandish scrolls than to give yourself to more
familiar pursuits. What was the code of the ponti-
fices, what the treaties, what the pedigree of the
sacrificial priest at Cures1 long before Numa's days,
what Castor2 had to say on all the shadowy kings,
what Rhodope published out of her husband⁷s books,
what the code of the priests, what the resolutions
of the old Quirites, what the decrees of the Senate,
what measures Draco or what Solon passed, and what
laws Zaleucus3 gave the Locrians, what Minos under
the reign of Jove, what Themis even before Jove’s
time—all these were better known to you than
our Tully or Maro, and all the stores of Roman
history. Maybe continued reading would have
brought them also within your ken, had not Lachesis
hurried on the date of your last journey. Your
post here in our city had brought you only a faint
tincture of renown, and given you but a slight fore-
taste of the title of grammarian, when you died on
the coast of far—off Cumae whither you had crossed
over from Sicily. But now that Ι have numbered
you in a company of famous men, rejoice—if this my
pious tribute reaches your shade.

² According to suidas, Castor was either a Rhodian, a
Galatiam or a Massilian. It was probably in his Χρονικέι
Ἀ’γνοήματα that he dealt with the early Roman kingS. Since
he is quoted by Apollodorus, his date is not later than
(·. 150 P..C. Of Rhodope (his wife ?) nothing is known.

3 ‹·. 660 Ro. His code was regarded by the Greeks as the
earliest written code which they possessed.
