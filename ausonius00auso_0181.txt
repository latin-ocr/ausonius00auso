THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

as its citizen. You may have strayed away and
spent your pains on a distant city, but the country
of your birth resumes its right to you. And now
your sons are following their father’s example, and
adding to the renown of Narbo and of Rome with
their learning. But why do we complain? After
long years, will they or nill they, Fame will bring
them also back to Bordeaux.

XX-STAPHmUs, THE RHETomcmN, A vass
oF AUSCIl

So far I have kept to the rule of commemorating
my fellow-countrymen, whether they taught in our
city or abroad. Yet it is no sin to couple with my
countrymen a single stranger such as you, Staphylius,
a son of Novem Populi. You were to me a father
and an uncle, both in one, like a second Ausonius,
like a second Arborius. As a grammarian you
rivalled Scaurus and Probus3 as a rhetorician, most
ready3 in history you knew all Livy and Herodotus.
You knew every branch of learning and all the lore
which Varro stored in his innumerable tomes. Your
heart was golden, your tongue persuasive and your
speech unflurried; no hesitating was there and yet
no hurrying. In old age you were comely and dis-
tinguished in appearance; anger and grief were
Strangers to you, and your peaceful life had a be-

fitting close.
