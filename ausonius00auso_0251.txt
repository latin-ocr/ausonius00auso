XXI.-ON THE FoUNDERs oF THE GAMEs

JUPiTER first hallowed the festival of the Olympian
Games at the long race-course ofthe Grecian stadium.
Next did the son of Alcaeus found the solemn
Nemean rite. These festivals also are held at ap-
pointed seasons once in four years-——the Isthmia,
established by Neptune, and the Pythia by Phoebus,
in honour of the dead worshipped both as human
and divine?

XXII.—T0 snow THAT THE SACRED CONTEsTs·
ΑΗΕ ALso HELD As FUNERARY GAMES

To Pelops, son of Tantalus, Elis dedicates its
tribute of woe. Thebes holds the Nemea each five
years in honour of Archemorus. 'Tis known that
the Isthmia commemorate Palaemon’s end. The
Delphians instituted their Pythian festival to appease
the dragon slain by Phoebus.3

'-’ The reference is to MelicerteS, son of Athamas and Ino,
with whom his mother leaped into the sea. He was trans-
formed into a sea-god and known thenceforward as· Palaemon
(the Roman Portumnus : cp. xx. 3). He had therefore been

both god and man.
