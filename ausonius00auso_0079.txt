THE DAILY ROUNI)

wrecking sea, bound at a stride across the straits,
and flit above the air on new-found wings. Then,
too, in dreanis we undergo amours unspeakable, and
night's foul shames, and unions which are the themes
of tragedy. Yet there is escape from these when-
ever shame bursts through the bonds of sleep, scat-
tering the horrors of our dreams, and the mind freed
from filthy fancying keeps watch. Then the hands
untainted feel about the bed nor find cause for re-
morse: the sinful guilt of luxury departs, and as the
dream fades from us, so its stain. Now, l see myself
applauding, one of a triumphant throng : again Ι am
dragged through the streets a disarmed Alan prisoner
of war. And now I gaze upon the temples of the
gods, their sacred portals and golden palaces3 or
seem to recline at a feast upon a couch of Sarran
(Tyrian) purple, and presently sit feasting at the
table of some steamy eating-house.

22 They say the heavenly bard1 set for the empty
phantoms of sluggish sleep a place beneath an elm-
tree's leaves, and appointed them two gates: that
which is arched with ivory ever pours forth upon the
air a host of deceptive shapes: the second is of horn
and sends forth visions of the truth. But if dreams
of doubtful import leave us the choice, better that
cheerful sights deceive us than we should sear with
a cause. Look you, Ι would even rather be deceived3
for, if only gloomy dreams always prove void, it is
better to have missed what might have been enjoyed
than to tremble at ill-fortune. ’Tis well enough it
only fear be far from us. Some there are also who
argue their woe and weal by contraries, and who
forecast results by opposite interpretation.
