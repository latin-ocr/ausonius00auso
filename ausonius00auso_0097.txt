PERSONAL POEMS

son rose to the highest pinnacle of dignity, as prefect
of all Gaul, Libya, and Latium,1 calm and kindly,
gentle of glance and speech and mien, in bearing
towards his father he was still a boy in mind and
heart. I lived to see his son and son-in-law pro-
consuls,2 and my hope was always sure that he
himself would be consul. My daughter enjoyed
the pride of the wedded state, and won the highest
praise both as wife and widow. She lived to see
her son, her son-in-law, and her granddaughter’s
husband all bring glory to their house in titles
manifold. And Ι, although Ι neither angled for
distinctions nor affected to disdain them, bore the
title of prefect of the great Illyricum. Such lavish
kindness on fortune's part moved me to praise my
God, and pray that my life might end before any
day with fell tooth should fret the unmarred span of
so fortunate a life. My prayers were heard and my
request was granted: now Ι am fallen asleep after
a peaceful end, and leave to others hopes, and
prayers, and fears. And SO, after the allowances3
for my funeral had been allotted, I lay amid grieving
friends, myself not grieving. Ninety years Ι lived,
without a staff, my body whole and unfailing in all
its functions. Whoe’er you are who shall read these
lines, you will not scorn to Say : “ Your life was such
as I pray mine may be.'’
