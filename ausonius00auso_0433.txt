A NUPTIAL CENTO

these conditions duly fulfilled according to rule, you
will say that I have compiled a cento. And because
Ι served at the time 1 under my commanding officer,
you will direct “that pay be issued to me as for
regular service ’¹ 32 but if otherwise, you will sentence
nie “ to forfeit pay,’' so that this “lump sum’' of
verse may be “returned to its proper pay-chest,’'
and the verses go back to the source from which
they came. Farewell.

Ι.-ΤΗΕ PREFACE

ΘΝΕ heed to these my words and hither turn
gladsome minds‚ ye twain for courage, ye twain for
prowess in arms renowned, ye twain who prosper—-
a breed invincible in war. And thou especially—
for there is clear assurance that under high omens
thou passest o'er the deep—than whom none ever
was more strict in reverence of the gods, none
greater in war and deeds of arms3 thou and thy
son, the second hope of mighty Rome, the flower and
excellence of heroes of old ‘time and my especial
charge—he who in name is his grandfather's double,
but in spirit and in might his father's. I sing as I
am bidden. To each his own essay shall bring toil
and event: for me ’tis Iawful to perform a task
enjoined.

¹ i.e. at the time of composition: the use of military
phraseology suggests that the cento was composed while
Ausonius was on active service, 368-{3 ΑΛ).

² Ausonius is here adapting the technical phraseology of
milit-ary administration.
