THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

XX VL-THE Pom

FAm: ye well, shades of famous rhetoricians: fare
ye well, worthy teachers, whether it were history, or
poetry, or eloquence in the courts that made you
famous 3 or whether medicine or Plato’s system won
⁴ you undying renown. And if any care of the living
please 'che dead, and if the tribute of 'cheir survivors
please them, then take the sad homage of my verse,
a fabric of tears and siglis. Undisturbed may your
ashes keep their place within the tomb, may the
memory of your names live on until that other age
return 1 in which, by grace of God our judge, we all
shall share!

¹ Ausonius apparently regards “ the world to come ’² as a
Golden Age which is to come baele to man. Doubtless he
had in mind Virgss, Eel. iv. 6 : redeunt Saturnia regna.
