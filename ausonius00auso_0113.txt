closely practised in his life as to live by the rule oi
wisdom rather than profess it, albeit he was not
unskilled nor lacking in the gift of eloquence. To
him was given the power to prolong men’s lives by
means of medicine, and make the Fates wait their
full time. Wherefore, though his life's task is ended,
so great a reverenee for him lingers yet that our own
age has given him this epitaph : “ Even as Ausonius
had none for him to follow, so he has none who now
can match his skill.’'

IL—AEM1L1A ΑΕΟΝΙΑ, Mv MOTHER

NEx'r will I sing of you, Aeonia, who gave me birth,
in whom was mingled the blood of a mother from
Tarbellae and of an Aeduan father. In you was found
every virtue of a duteous wife, chastity renowned,
hands busy spinning wool, truth to your bridal vows,
pains to bring up your children : sedate were you yet
friendly, sober yet bright. Now that for ever you
embrace your husband's peaeeful shade, still eheer in
death his tomb, as once in life you eheered his bed.

BRo'rHER

NATURAL affection bade me utter first my father's
and my mother's names, and yet Arborius refuses to
take third place. Though it were an outrage to
mention him first and my father after him, yet again
it is scarcely less to deny him the first place. So let
us compromise3 let him be named next, before all
others, although he will be second to my father.
