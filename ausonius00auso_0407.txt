CONCLU'SION orss THE BOOK oF ANNALs

II.—A CALCULATION OF THE YEARs ERoM THE
FOUNDATloN OF THE C1Tv DowN To MY CONSULATE

To eleven times a hundred years join four, then
add eleven times one and three beside.1 This will
be the tale of years passed since the beginning of
eternal Rome.

III.—L1NEs WRITTEN AT THE END OF THE SAME: Boox

UP to this point have I written my annals. If
Fortune will, I will carry them yet further3 if not,
you who read will add to them. Would you know
who Ι am? Look up the entry which is fourth from
the last:2 you will read the name of Ausonius the
Consul.

IV.—ON THE SAME

WHEN you receive this sequence of the years οῖ
our eterna] city traced down from the time of King
Quirinus, you will read that a thousand years, a
hundred and twice nine have ebbed away ere you
come on the name of Ausonius the Consul. Per-
chance when five years have been added to that
tale, Proculus3 shall seal the complete Olympiad.

2 These lines were therefore written in 382 A.D., while I.
and ΙΙ. were composed in 379 ΑΛ). It is noteworthy that
this poem addresses neither Hesperius nor Proculus, but the
general reader (cp. 1. 2, qni ἱερεῖς ; l. 3, scire cupis qni sim ἕ).

³ Proculus Gregorius was praefectus praetorio of the Gauls
382-3, and this book was therefore re-dedicated to him in
383. Ausonius evidently anticipated that he would be
consul in 384, but the arrangement was upset by the revolt
of Maximus (383) and death of Gratian.
