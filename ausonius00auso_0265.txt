ΙΝ the aerial fields, told of in Virgil’s verse, where
groves of myrtle o’ershade lovers 10111, the 1161011163
were holding frantie rites, each one of them bearing
tokens of the death she died of old, and wandering
in a great wood, lit by scanty light, 'mid tufted
reeds, and full-blown poppies, and still meres with-
out a ripple, and unbabbling streams, along whose
banks flowers of woe hung drooping in the murky
light, bearing the names of kings and boys of old:
here was admiring Narcissus, Hyacinthus, son of
Oebalus, golden-headed Crocus, Adonis purple-
stained, and Aeas of Salamis inscribed with the
word of woe.l All things which, fraught with grief
or with the pangs of love, prolong the memory of
sorrow even when death is passed, call back again
the 1161011163 to the lives which they have lost. Here
pregnant Semele, robbed of her hopes, bewails her
birthpangs amid the lightning, and in the void rends
a charred cradle and brandishes the harmless fire of
an imagined thunderbolt. Bewailing the unavailing
gift of manliood in which she once rejoiced, Caenis 2
grieves for her restoration to her former shape.
Procris3 still staunches her wounds, and loves the
fatal hand of Cephalus which struck her down. The
maid of Sestos4 carries her smoking earthen lamp
and casts herself headlong from her tower. And
man-like Sappho, doomed to be slain by the shafts

² The girl Caenis was changed by Poseidon into a man
and made invulnerable. As a man he bore the name Caeneus.

3 Daughter of Erechtheus and wife of Cephalus. In her
36310113)ν she hid in a thicket to spy on her husband while
hunting, and was speared by Cephalus, who supposed a wild
beast was lurking there. 4 36. Hero.
