INTRODUCTION·

Italy, and the usurper was master of the Western
Empire. The prospects of the favourites of the old
regime were definitely at an end. What Ausonius
did during the domination of Maximus is unknown.
From the explanatory note prefixed to Epist. xx, we
learn that when the storm burst he was at Treves
(he had no doubt returned to the court there) and it
is possible that his continued stay in the city was in
fact a detention at the order of Maximus. But if this
is so, it is likely that he was soon permitted to return
to his native Bordeaux. ’

When at length Theodosius overthrew Maximus
(388 A.D.) Ausonius may indeed have visited the court
(cp. Praqf. iii.)‚ but was too old for public life.
Heneeforth his days were spent in his native pro-
vince, where he lived chiefly on his own estates,
paying occasional visits, which he disliked or affected
to dislike‚ to Bordeaux (Domest. i. :29 ff., Epist. vi.
17 ΗΣ). Here he passed his time in enjoyment of the
sights and sounds of the country (Epist. xxvii. 90 ff.)2
in dallying with literary pursuits, and in the company
of friends similarly disposed.

The date of his death is not definitely known, but
may be presumed to have occurred at the close of 393
or in 394, since nothing from his hand can be as-
signed to a later year. He was then over eighty
years of age.

In connection, however, with his life something
must be said on his attitude towards Christianity.
