A RIDDLE OF THE NUMBER THREE

bare in turn, Vesta, Ceres, and J uno, a female com-
pany. So triple-barbed are Jove’s thunderbolts, so
is it with Cerberus, so with the trident, and the triple
egg whence Helen. and her brethren came. Thrice
was the distaff of Nestor's destiny replenished with
purple yarn, and as many times doth the crow out-
live that triple span.1 And could she roll into one
nine times the periods of three ages, yet by thrice
Nestor’s triple span do brazen-footed stags surpass
hei-,2 whereof three lifetimes doth the sacred bird
of Phoebus-⁹> overpass, to be nine times outstripped
by that fowl of Ganges, radiate of head within his
nest of cinnamon.4

13 Triple in form is Hecate, three faces has virgin
Diana3 three the Graces, three the Fates‚ three tones
hath the voice ,5 three are the elements.6 Three Sirens
were in three-cornered Sicily, triple in all respects:
three birds, three demi-goddesses, three semi-maids,⁷
with thrice three Muses8 bidden to strive for the
palm, employing lips, hands, and breath, making
melody with pipes, strings, and voice. Three the
branches of Pliilosopliy,9 three the Punic Wars,
three months go to each change in the year and
clime, threefold the watches which share Night's
gloom. Thrice doth that tardy sentinel,10 who let
Mars be caught, sound the clear call of approaching

⁵ Treble‚ tenor, and bass. ⁰ Air, fire, and water.

⁷ The Sirens were pictured as half—human and half-bird:
the divine clement in them was due to their birth from
Phorcys. ⁸ For this see Pausanias, lx. xxxiv. 2.

⁹ Natural, Moral, and Rational : see Quintilian, XII. ii. 10.

²⁰ Alectryon, stationed by Ares to give warning of the
approach of Helios (on the occasion celebrated by Demo-
docus), slept at his post and allowed Helios to descry the
lovers. In punishment, he was changed into a cock: see
Lucian, Somnium, 3.
