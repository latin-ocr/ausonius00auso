A RIDDLE OF THE NUMBER THREE

is broken up in common use. In natural science are
three prime causes, God, matter, and the shape
given:l three-formed is all formation, the former,
the formatrix, and the f01·med.2

⁵0 Over three kinds ranges the figure of the triangle,
equilateral, isosceles, and scalene. Three parts com-
bined make up the perfect number,3 in such wisc
that if a group thrice three be formed, by three
times three the same may be resolved. Three is the
first number which has an odd, an even, and a medial
unit: but, as the unit itself divides4 three, so does
it five and seven3 and when 'tis placed under5 the
central point of the full number, it parts 111 two a
series of thirds forming a continuous cube,6 by sepa-
rating even and equal groups from the uneven threes:
and even numbers thrice find a centre, when the
same midmost point of four, six, and twice four, is
bracketed.

⁶1 Triple the code which Tables 7 four times three
ordained: the canon, the private, and the common

odd number, 3, with a unit differentiating them 3 since
2 ÷ 1 -- 3). Ν1116 (3 >< 3) contains three uneven numbers
(3, 5, 7) possessing such a media] unit (111, 11111, 1111111) and, if
the medi-‘il is placed “under'’ the eentre (i.e. left out of
count), itself is transformed from an odd group of three (zze,
of three threes: impare terito, l. 58) into two equal (aequi-
pares, l. 58) of four each: the medial unit then marks 1116
centre of the thirds (trientes, l. 57) which make up the cube 8
(sc. 2 >< 2 >< ⁴2: (52). Mart. Capella, vii. ἓ 740). th again, if
the medial unit is treated as a mark only, it shows the centre
of three even numbers also which are contained in nine, viz.
4, 6,8(11111, 1111111, nulum).

‘¹ i.e. divides it into two equal groups.

⁵ i.e. when it is withdrawn from the sum and is treated as
a mere mark.

6 Literally, “the thirds solid (sc. united) in a continuous
611116.” ⁷ sc. the Twelve Tables.
