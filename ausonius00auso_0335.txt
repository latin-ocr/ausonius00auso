THE ORDER OF FAMOUS CITIES

once contended——of her to whom the peace-bearing
olive tree first belonged, whose is the unmixed glory
of the fluent Attio tongue, from whom went abroad a
Grecian band and throughout the peoples of Ionia
and the Achaean race poured into a hundred cities.1

XVI.—-CATANA. XVII.——SYRACUSE

Wflo would not tell of Catana? Who not, of four-
sold 2 Syracuse ?—the one renowned for the devotion
of the fi1·e-scathed brethren,3 the other enfolding the
marvellous fount and 1·11ῖ61·,4 where, flowing beneath
the salt waves of the Ionian Sea, they join in fellow-
ship their sweet waters in the abode which pleases
thein——exchanging there the kisses of their waters
untainted by the brine.

XVIII.—TotJLousx‹:

Navm will I leave unmentioned Toulouse, my
nursing-mother, who is girt about with a vast circuit
of brick—built walls, along whose side the lovely stream
of the Garonne glides past, home of uncounted people,
lyinghard by the barriers of the snowy Pyrenees and
the pine-clad Cevennes between the tribes of Aqui-
taine and the Iberian folk. Though lately she has
poured forth from her womb four several cities, she
feels no loss of her drained populace, enfolding in
her bosom all whom she has brought forth, though
emigrants.5

⁴ Arethusa and Alpheus, believed to emerge, with their
streams still fresh, on the island of Ortygia in Syracuse : see
Strabo, p 270, and cp. Virgil, Ed. x. 4.

⁵ i.e Toulouse had thrown out four new subm-bs, and thus,
while founding new “ eities‚⁷' did not lose her “ e111ig1·ants.⁷'

In Epist. xxx. 83 Ausonius speaks of Toulouse as quinque-
plicem in allusion to the same extension.
