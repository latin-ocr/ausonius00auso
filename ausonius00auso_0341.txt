THE ORDER OF FAMOUS CITIES

in its headlong course through the twice six sluices
in its long-drawn brink, and never fails to meet the
people's countless purposes? This would'st thou
long to reach with thy hosts, King of the Medes,
when streams were consumed and rivers failed31
from this fount to carry waters through strange
cities, thou who through them all wast wont to drink
Choaspes alone 1 2

30 Hail, fountain of source unknown,3 holy,
gracious‚ unfailing‚ crystal-clear, azure‚ deep, mur-
murous, shady, and unsulliedl Hail, guardian deity
of our city, of whom we may drink health-giving
draughts, named by the Celts Divona,4—a fountain
added to the roll divine ! Not Aponus in taste, not
Nemausus5 in azure sheen is more clear, nor
Timavus'6 sea-like flood more brimming-full.

36 Let this last task conclude the muster of famous
cities. And as illustrious Rome leads at one end of
the rank, so at this end let Bordeaux establish her
place, leaving the precedence unsettled. This is
my own country3 but Rome stands above all coun-
tries. 1 love Bordezwx, Rome 1 venerate3 in this I
am a citizen, in both a consul; here was my cradle‚
there my curule chair.

(Pauly-WVissowQ Realencycl.) gives its meaning as “God-
like, gleaming'’: George Long (Dice. of Cla-ss. (2609.) derives
it from the Celtic cli or div (z God), and onor von ( z water).
It is perhaps connected with Der-a (the River Dee).

5 Aponus (now Bagni d'Abano)‚ near Patavium, was a
famous Roman watering place (see Claudian, Iclyll. vi.):
Nemausus is Nimes.

⁶ Now the Timao, between Aquileia and Trieste: cp.
