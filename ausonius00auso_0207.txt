XXV-Fon HECUBA

I wflo was a queen, Ι, famous Dymas' child, Ι,
Priam's wife, I who bare Hector, Ι, Hecuba, perished
here, o’erwhelmed with showers of stoneS, though
not before the fury of my tongue had avenged me.
Put not your trust in royal state, nor motherhood,
nor lofty birth, ye who read this my Cynosema,1

XXVL—Fon Porvxmi

l AM Polyxena of Troy, mated with Achilles in the
tomb: would rather I had died without a sod to
cover me. You do not well, Achaeans, to unite
enemies in the grave : this was to violate, rather than
to bury me.

XXVII.——ON NIOBE Binum) oN Mon-NT Slpx'LUs
NEAR A FOUNTAIN

A QUEEN of Thebes was Ι, who ani now a crag
of Sipylus for my offence against the godhead of
Leto’s offspring. Happy and proud to have borne
twice seven children, Ι buried as many as Ι bare.
Yet even this did not content the gods: hard stone
encased me round until Ι lost all shape of human
form. But though my vital parts are crusted o'er,
grief clings to them and pours forth a perpetual
stream of pitying tears. Ah, cruel deed! Do
heavenly spirits hate so bitterly? A mother's grief
lasts on, her shape passes away.
