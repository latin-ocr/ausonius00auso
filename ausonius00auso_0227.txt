THE ECLOGUES

But we, the Hamadryad NymphS, the longest-lived
of living things, pass through ten lifetimes of the
Phoenix in continuous span.

⁹ This limit bounds the lives of living creatures.
As for the rest, God, the disposer of all hidden
time, knows what periods Stilbon1 and what ages
Phaen0n2 have to roll, what orbits Pyro'1's3 and the
benignant fires of Jupiter must yet fulfil, or in what
revolutions kindly Venus hastens on her way, or how
long are the toils that yet await Phoebe (the Moon)
and Titan (the Sun), before that which they call the
Great Year4 reaches its close, and the wandel-ing
stars come back again in their ancient courses as
they stood at the beginning of the ordered universe.

VL—ON THE NATURE OF THE POUND on BALANCE

WHoso you are who wonder that the vast heavenly
bodies still endure, hung round about the lofty circle
of the firmament, and that no decay creeps in upon
their mighty mass, hearken‚ that you may wonder
yet the more. First-beginnings of utmost fineness
and which baffle our sight, are in these great bodies:
they hold close together, closely linked in a group
of tiny atoms3 but in these tiny atoms is a solid
particle which cannot be parted. Hence comes
it that their strength and power endure, and that
these motions are not overcome by any lapse of
time. We may compare things human with divine.

¹ The Glittering One (Mercury).

2 The Shining One (saturn). ²³ The Fiery One (Mars).

⁴ i.e. the Cycle of Ages (Shelley’s “the world’s Great
Age ”)‚ at the close of which all things will return to their
primitive state and a new Cycle begin. cp. Virgil, Ecl.
iv. 4 ff.
