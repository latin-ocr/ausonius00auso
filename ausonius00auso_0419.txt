A RIDDLE OF THE NUMBER THREE

Dawn. And he 1 who was conceived in the darkness
of a tripled night2 hung up the spoils enjoined on
thriee four trophies.

3⁰ Also the lyric poets are of one number with the
Mnemosynae,3 three of whom only Phoebus once
held in his right handz4 but Cithaeron dedicated
three times three in bronze ⁵—sueh was our fathers'
piety, who feared to slight the six. Thriee a year
were games held at Tarentum 6 lasting three nightS,
like the three-yearly festival at Thebes-for twice-
born Bacchus. The three first combats of gladiators
matched in three pairs—these were the offering made
by the sons of J unius at their father's sepulchre] She
too, who asked her triple riddle of the suitors of the
queen 8—what one being was two-legged, four-legged,
and three-legged‚ and yet the same—the Sphinx who
affrighted Aonia, was of triple shape, part bird, part
lioness‚ part maid—in wings a bird, in paws a beast,
in face a girl.

42 Three are the allied gods who shine in the temple
on the Tarpeian rock. Threefold the crafts which
shape man's dwelling-place: one man lays stones in
the walls, a second beams in the roof, a third adds
the last covering of tiles. Three is a factor of the
quadrantal⁹ of Bromius, as also of the Sicilian me-
dimnus: this into three, that into twice three parts 10

⁶ In honour of Persephone and Dis. This Tarentum was a
spot near the Campus Martius, and not the Campanian city.

⁷ Gladiatorial oombats were first held in 265 B.C. by
Marcius and Decius Brutus at the obsequies of their father z
see Valerius Max. 11. iv. 7 (and cp. Εσῖοφιω, xxiii. 33 and
note).

⁸ Jocasta, whose hand was to reward the man who solved
the riddle of the Sphinx. ⁹ sc. the amphora.
