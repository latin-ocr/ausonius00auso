THE MOSELLE

gold-bearing Tarnes in lower place3 and, though he
rushes madly 'mid wide-rolling rocks, yet shall
Tarbellic Aturrus only pass into the dark 303 when
he 1133 first done homage to the deity of sovereign
Moselle.

4⁶9 Horned Moselle, worthy to be renowned
throughout foreign lands, and not to be renowned in
those parts alone where at thy farthest source thou
dost reveal the gilded glory of a bull-like brow 31 or
where amid embaying fields thou dost wind thy
peaceful course; or where below German harbours
thou dost clear thy outfall 3—if any praise shall choose
· to breathe upon this feeble strain, if anyone shall
deign to waste his leisure 011 my verse, thou shalt
pass upon the lips of men, and be cherished with
joyful song. Of thee springs and living lakes shall
learn, of thee azure rivers, of thee ancient groves,
the glory of our villages, to thee Druna, to thee
Druentia,2 wandering uncertainly between her shift-
ing banks, shall do reverence with all the Alpine
streams, and Rhodanus who, flowing through that two-
fold city, gives a name to the Right Bank ; 3 thee will
I praise to the dark meres and deep-voiced tributaries,
thee will I praise to sea-like Garonne.

² The Drome and the Durance.

³ The city is Arles, which was intersected by ‘the Rhodanus
(Rhone): cp. Ordo Urbium iVobz'Zz‘um, x. 1. An inscription
from Narbonne (0.I.L. xii. 4398) shows that Ripa Dextra
was a recognised place-name.
