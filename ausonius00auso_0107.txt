PARENTALIA 1

PREFACE IN Pnosr:

l KNow that it is the fate of my poor poems to be
read with a feeling of weariness ε that is indeed what
they deserve. But some are recommended by their
subject-matter3 and at times, perhaps, the explana-
tory heading alone so attracts the reader that, allured
by its gaiety‚ he cheerfully puts up with its insipid-
ness. This little volume is neither cheerful as regards
its subject, nor atti-active in title. It is endued with
that mournful affection with which I commemorate
in sorrowing love the loss of my deal· ones. The book
is headed Parentalia, after the solemn day 2 so called
in ancient times, being indeed appointed so long ago
as the times of Numa for offerings to departed re-
latives. The loving respect of the living has, indeed,
no more sacred office it can perform than to call to
mind with due reverence those who are lost to us.
