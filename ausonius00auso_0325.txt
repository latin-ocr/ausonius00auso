THE ORDER OF FAMOUS CITIES

L-Rom:

Fmsr among cities, the home of gods, is golden
Rome.

ΙΙ., HL—CoNsmNTmopm AND CARTHAGE

CARTHAGE yields precedence in rank to Constan-
tinople, but will not stand a full step lower ; for she
scorns to be counted third, yet dares not hope for
the second place, which both have held. One has
the advantage in 1161· ancient wealth, the other in
her new-born prosperity: the 0116 has seen her day,
the other is now rising and by the lostiness of new
achievements eclipses old-time renown, forcing Elissa
to give place to Constantine. Carthage reproaches
Heaven, now fully shamed if this time also she must
give place who scarcely brooked the pre-eminence
of Rome.

10 Let your earlier conditions reconcile your
jealousies. Go forward equal, mindful at length
that 'twas through Heaven's power ye changed
your narrow sortunes and your names3 thou, when
thou wast Byzeintine Lyg0813 and thou, Punic ssy1·sa.2
