A NUPTIAL CENTO

heroic verse admits, so that either a penthemimeris
( ------- ) can be linked with an anapaestic con-
tinuation ( υυυυυυυυυυ ), or a trochaic fragment
( -------- ) with a complementary section
( ψψψψψψψψψ ), or seven half-feet ( υυυυυυυυυυ )
with a choric anapaest ( ----- ), or after a dactyl
and a half-foot (- υ υ-) is placed whatever is needed
to complete the hexameter: so that you may say
it is like the puzzle which the Greeks have called
ostomaclziafl There you have little pieces of bone,
fourteen in number and representing geometrical
figures. For some are equilateral triangles, some
with sides of various lengths, some symmetrical,
some with right angles, some with oblique : the same
people call them isosceles or equal-sided triangles,
and also right-angled and scalene. By fitting these
pieces together in various ways, pictures of countless
object-s are produced z a monstrous elephant, a brutal
boar, a goose in flight, and a gladiator in armour, a
huntsman crouching down, and a dog barking—even
a tower and a tankard and numberless other things
of this sort, whose variety depends upon the skill of
the player. But while the harmonious arrangement
of the skilsul is marvellous, the jumble made by the
unskilled is grotesque. This prefaced, you will know
that I am like the second kind of player.

And so this little work, the Cento, is handled in
the same way as the game described, so as to har-
monize different meanings, to make pieces arbitrarily
connected seem naturally related, to let foreign ele-
ments show no chink of light between, to prevent
the far-fetched from proclaiming the force which
united thern, the closely packed from bulging un-
duly, the loosely knit from gaping. If you find all
