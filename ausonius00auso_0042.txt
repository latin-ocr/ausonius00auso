clearly showing that he kept by him a collection of

all his published or finished work. The fruits thus
garnered were reissued 111 three ‘⁶ collected editions.''
The first of these, prefaced by a dedication to Gratian
(Epigr. xxvi), appeared in or just before 383 A.D.;
the second was drawn up c. 390 Aa). at the request
of the Emperor Theodosius (Praeffal. iii„ iv.); and
finally a collection, including second editions of old
poems and works hitherto unpublished or which had
appeared only in separate form, was issued after
Ausonius' death by his son Hesperius or some
intimate friend, probably in 3931 This conclusion
may be drawn from the lemma of Epist. xx. which is
in the third person (contrary to Ausonius' practice)
and, after mentioning the circumstances in which the
letter was written, states that it is ‘⁶ unfinished and
copied as it stands from the rough draft '³ ε similarly
the lemma to the de Herediolo (Domest. i.) is in the
third person. In both cases it is clear that Ausonius is
not the writer, but someone (such as Hesperius) very
intimately acquainted with the details of his life. To
this editor the intrusion of the miscellaneous epitaphs
(Epitaphs xxvii—xxxv.) at the end of the series on the
Trojan XVar heroes may be due ς though it is possible
that they were placed there by the author himself
who intended to expand them into a distinct work
standing next to the original series:
