THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

rhetorician, you became g1·amma1·ian.1 In the courts
you were the bulwark of the accused3 in the country
you farmed y·ou1 estate, and deseived long to enjoy
the fruits you earned Obliging, cheerful, kindly
temperate, you were always as ready to give advice
as silent when you had given it. At once all 'che
pride of your kin as presently their sorrow, you leave
all desolate, my Glabrio, rest from us by untimely
death : wife, children, father, mother, left—alas,
under how many names were you lost to them 12 Long
mourned by me, though never mourned enough, your
name is here recorded for all time3 and so, friend
Glabrio, receive my sorrowful farewell ἶ

KNow that these men, of whom you read in order
after the exordium 3 of my book, were once teachers
in my native place, Some of grammar, some of rhe-
toric, and some of both. T—hey are dead, and it is
enough that I have recalled their memories. For
the living praise is a lure: to but cry their names4
will satisfy those within the tomb. Wherefore, do
you, who in my pages read these mournful trifles,
not look for pomp of words but for the affection
wherewith my reverent care makes offering to famous
and learned men, while it recalls the glories of my
splendid native land.

To call aloud upon the dead was a recognised funemry rite:
see Virgss, Aen. vi. 507: magna Manes* tei voce xocavi3 id.
