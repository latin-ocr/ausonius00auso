THE TWELVE CAESARS

XXII.——BAss1ANus ANTonus OR CARACALLA

UNLIKE thy father 1 in manliness, and still less like
him 2 by whose usurped name thou dost style thyself
——tliou, guilty of thy brother's death 3 and punished
with a bloody end, to thy jeering people art rather
Caracalla.4

XXI I I.—O121Lms MACRINUS

Nam Macrinus, the prince’s guard, turns the sword
he wore for Caesar's sake against him who gave it
—even in murder sluggish.5 Soon with his son 6 is
he o’erthrown. Let him cease to assail treachery
with sore complaints: what he suffers he desei-ved.

xxiv—Amomws HEL1oGAssALus

DosT thou also defile the sanctuary of the Augustan
palace, falsely bearing the name of the Antonines 7—
thou, than whom no fouler or more filthy monster
ever filled the imperial throne of Rome?

‘¹ From the hooded Gaulish overall affected by Caracalla:
see Spartianus, Carae. ix. ,

⁵ Probably because Macrinus did not commit the murder
himself, but through Martial, Caracalla's groom.

Β Antoninus Diadumenus.

⁷ cp. Lampridius, Heliogyab. ii.: . . . quamvis sanctum illud
Antoninorum nomen polluerit.
