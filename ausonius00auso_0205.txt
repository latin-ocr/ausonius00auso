XXI.—FOR H1ppownoijs AND Px-Lmrs BUmEn
IN A GARDEN

proTHoijs and Pyleus 1 lie buried 111 this ignoble
3011, and over their bodies mallows and cabbages
grow green. And yet the tilling of the garden
· troubles not their peaceful ashes, if these soft herbs
are tilled by no rude hands.

ΧΧΙΙ.ψ-Ὲο11ι ENNOMUS AND CHROMIUS

ENNOMUS and Chromius 2 lie here : Mysia was 'cheir'
kingdom, Alcinoiis their father, Oeean their ancestor.
What profits them so illustrious a descent? The
brighter their ancestry‚ the heavier their lot when

dead.
XX111.-F0R PmAM

HERE is not Priam’s tomb, nor am Ι buried in this
place: the Danaans despoiled me of my head. A
mangled, nameless end was 1111116, and 30 Ι, 1113 311·6,
ssed for shelter to Hector’s ashes. There Ι found my
sons, and Troy and Asia buried together, and what-
soever of mine 1163 scattered everywhere.

XXIV.-F01z PmAM Amm

HE who seeks Priam’s tomb must find Hector's
first. That tomb is mine which Ι first gave my 3011.

XX1VA.-F0n HECTOR

Ham: in 0116 common grave lie Hector and his
country, for in their fall both were united.
