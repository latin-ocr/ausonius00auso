PERSONAL POEMS

mellow what Summer has matured, and let jolly
Winter enjoy his portion due. Let the world live
at peace, and no stars of trouble hold sway.

Come, Jcmus,· come, Nem sem,- come, Sem, ›1¹in
strength renewed !

'2⁶ Gradivus, let no star but such as favours thee
invade thy house—not Cynthia, nor swift Arcas
nearest to the earth, nor thou, O Saturn, moving
remote in thy distant orbit: far from the Fiery
Planet thou shalt move on thy peaceful course. Ye
in conjunction move, star of health-bringing Jove,
and Cytherean Vesper, nor ever let the Cyllenian,1
so complaisant to his guests, tarry far off.

Come, Jamcs; come, Nem Year; come, San, wille
strength renewed !

34 All foes now vanquished2 (where the mixed
Frankish and Swabian bordes vie in submission,
seeking to serve in our Roman armies3 and where
the wandering bands of Huns had made alliance
with the Sarmatian3 and where the Getae with their
Alan friends used to attack the Danube—for Victory
borne on swift wings gives me the news of this), lo
now the Emperor comes to grace my dignity‚ and
with his favour crowns the distinction which he
would fain have shared.

Come, Jcmus,· come, Nem Year,· come, Suu, with
strength renemed !

42 Offer thy golden joys, O Sun, to Janus, soon
to come. A year, and Caesar shall succeed to the
insignia of Ausonius, and wear for the fifth time the
in Alsace). In the Gratiarmn Accio (ch. ii.) Gratiam is
credited with having restored peace along the frontiers of
the Rhine and the Danube in a single year. The reference

to a message here supposed to be brought-by Victory is
probably anticipatory.
