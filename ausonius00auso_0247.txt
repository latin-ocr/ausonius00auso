finish of the summer days. Ten times nine days
and two and half a day, when hours of light and
night are even, the golden Sun passes through in
his second race from the Crab to the claws of the
Scorpion, mingling the bounds of autumn and of sum-
mer. Then, traversing the autumn months in turn,
he passes on to the tropic1 star of chill Capricorn,
adding further to his tale eight days and ten times
eight with a fourth part of the day, which in each
fourth year stands at the close of Numa’s month and
takes the name of “intercala1·y.'' Then, hastening
toward the horns of Agenor's Eun, the golden Sun
climbs up to the tropic star of the fleecy Ram, con-
fining ninety days within ordained bounds. Here,
then, you have the full round of the ever-circling
years : three hundred and three score days and five.

THE tropic star of Capricorn prescribes the open-
ing of ,Janus's reign. In the midst of Numa's
month stands the sign of stout Aquarius. The
Fishes twain come forth in days of March. Thou,
Ram of Phrixus, lookest back on April's calends.
May marvels at the horns of Agenor’s Bull. June
sees the Spartan twins march 111 the heavens. July
brings the star of the Crab which blazes at the sol-
stice. The raging lion scorches the month of August
with his fires. Beneath thy star, O Virgin, September
loads the vines. October's seed-time balances the
Scales. The wintry Scorpion bids November go head-
]ong. The Archer ends his shining in mid- December
