A NU PTIAL CENTO

II.—THE MARRIAGE FEAsT

THE looked-for day was come, and at the noble
bridal, matrons and men, with youths under their
parents' eyes, gather together and recline on cover-
lets of purple. Servants bring water for their hands,
load in baskets the gifts of hard-won Ceres, and
bear the roasted flesh¹ of fat game. Most ample
the list of their dainties: all kinds of fowl and flesh
with wanton goat are present there, and sheep and
playful kids, the watery tribe, and does, and timid
stags: before their gaze and in their hands are
mellow apples.

22 When hunger had been put away and desire for
food was stayed, great mixing bowls are set and wine
is served. Hymns do they chant, they beat the
ground in dances, and songs repeat. Withal, a long-
robed Thracian priest accompanies on his seven
strings their various toneS. But on another side
the flute breathes song from its twin mouths. All
have the same repose from toil‚ and all arising leave
the tables: passing in a throng over the jocund
threshold, the company of fathers, mothers, boys,
disperses into ever-changing groups, their voices
echoing through the spacious halls beneath the
lamps which from the gilded fretting hang.
