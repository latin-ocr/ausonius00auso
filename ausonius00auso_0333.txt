Arelate—Arelas, the little Rome of Gaul, to whom
Martian 2 Narbonne, to whom V ienne, rich in Alpine
peasantry,3 is neighbour—divided by the streams
of headlong Rhone in suchwise that thou mak'st a
bridge of boats thy eentral st1·eet‚4 whereby thou
gatherest the merchandize of the Roman world and
scatterest it, enriching other peoples and the towns
which Gaul and Aquitaine treasure in their wide
bosoms.

XL—Sssvnffl. XII.-C0RnovA. XIII.—TARRAGONA.
XIV—BRAGA

tends with you, nor wealthy Eraga, lying proudly in
her bay beside the sea.

fathers,8 the stronghold for which Pallas and Consus 9

the deputy of the praetorian prefect of Gaul.

autochtlmnous, sprung from the soil itself.

9 Neptune (Poseidon). Athens was to be called after
whichever of the two deities produced the more useful gift.
