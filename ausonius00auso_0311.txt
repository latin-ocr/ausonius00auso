THE MOSELLE

outfall beneath imperial walls.l No whit beneath
him is blest Alisontia 2 who laps fruit-laden banks as
he glides silently through rich corn-lands. A
thousand others, according to the vehemence of each
which drives him on, long to become thine: such is
the ambition of these hurrying streams or such their
character. But if to thee, O divine Moselle, Smyrna
or famed Mantua had given its own poet,3 then would
Simois, renowned on Ilium's coasts, yield place, and
Tiber would not dare to set his glories above thine.
Pardon, O pardon me, mighty Rome! Rebuffed—I
pray—let Envy withdraw, and Nemesis who knows
no Latin name! To thee, O Tiber, belongs this
higher praise, that thou dost guard the seat of empire
and the homes of Rome.

³³³¹ Hail, mighty mother both of fruits and men'
Thy illustrious nobles, thy youth trained to war, thy
eloquence which vies with the tongues of Rome——
these are thy glories, O M oselle l And withal, Nature
has bestowed upon thy sons virtue and a blithe spirit
with unclouded brows. Not Rome alone vaunts her
old-time Catos, nor does Aristides stand alone as the
one only critic of Justice and of Right.

339 But why, coursing along too freely with loose
rein, do Ι, o’ercome with love, wear out thy praises ? 4
Put by the lyre, my Muse, striking the last chords
which end thy song! The time shall come when,
as Ι soothe my sorrows and cherish age that loves
sunny nooks with the pursuits of inglorious ease,5
the glory of my theme shall commend me, when to
their glory and renown I shall sing the achievements
