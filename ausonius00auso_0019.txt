INTRODUCTION

§wien and how he adopted the new religion there is
nothing to show; but certain of his poems make it
clear that he professed and called himself a Christian,
and such poems as the Oratio (Eplzemeris iii.) and
Domestica ii., which show a fairly extensive know-
ledge of the Scriptures‚ sometimes mislead the
unwary to assume that Ausonius was a devout and
pious soul. But in these poems he is deliber-
ately airing his Christianity: he has, so to speak,
dressed himself for church. His everyday attitude
was clearly very different. When Paulinus began
to conform his life to what he believed to be the
demands of Christianity, Ausonius is totally unable
to understand his friend’s attitude and can only
believe that he is crazed. A devout and pious
Christian might have combated the course chosen
by Paulinus, but hc would certainly have sym-
pathised with the principle which dictated it. Nor
does Christianity enter directly or indirectly into the
general body of his literary work (as distinguished
from the few ‘⁶ set pieces ''). In the Parentalia there
is no trace of Christian sentiment—and this though he
is writing of his nearest and dearest: the rite which
gives a title to the book is pagan, the dead “rejoice
to hear their names pronounced'’ (Parent. Pref. 11),
they are in Elysium (id. iii. 23) or in Erebus (id. xxvii.
4) or amongst the Manes (id. xviii. 1⁵2) according to
pagan orthodoxy3 but in his own mind Ausonius
certainly regards a future existence as problematical
(Parent. xxii. 15 and especially Proff. i. 39 ff).
