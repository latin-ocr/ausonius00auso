iNTRODUC-TION

cannot be traced3 but since they contain nothing in
common they are probably to be regarded as
complementary to one another. F urther, most of
their contents are common to Γ, but include nothing
peculiar to the Z gronp as contrasted with Γ. Con-
sequently it is probable that P and Eme. are related
to V3 and the presence in them of some matter not
to be found in Γ, eg. the letter of Theodosius (Praqfi
iii.) and the ilfoselle, suggests that they were derived
from a inore complete representative of this collec-
tion than the extant Leyden MS.

If this is 50, the gronps may be reduced to two—ron
the one side the Z MSS, and 011 the other V and the
selections. Of these two main groups, Z, which opens
with a dedication to Gratian and contains nothing
later than 353 A.D., represents the first collected
edition, and V, with related MSS„ reproduces the
“posthumous '² edition of 393 A.D.

Such in its broad outlines appears to be the history
of the text. Peiper, however, has put forward a very
different theory. All the MSS. were derived (he
holds) from a single copy of the final collected edition,
and this archetype was split into two parts, the former
being the ancestor of the Z group, the latter of V,
which was suppleniented by the remains of another
copy (perhaps the ancestor of Z> in a very decayed
condition. As for P and Erre„ they are to be traced
to a defective MS. akin to, but earlier than the
ancestor of Γ, since it contained the Mosella and other
matter not preserved in that MS.
