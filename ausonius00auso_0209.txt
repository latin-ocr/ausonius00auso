a cask ? '’ 2 “ Cerberus will not let him in.’' “ Where
is he gone, then? '⁷ “ VVhere the bright star of Leo

XXIX-morsum EPITAPH oN DIOGENES4

A HAVERSACK, some barley-meal, a eloak, a stick, a
cup—these were the Cynie’s scanty furniture; but
now he thinks this over much. For, seeing a
bumpkin drink from his hollowed hands, quoth he:
“ Why do I carry you about, you useless cup? ”

ΧΧΧ.-ΑΝΟΤΗΕΗ EPITAPH 5

KING Croesus, wealthiest of kings, Diogenes the
Cynic saw your form amongst the shades. Said he :
“Now you have nothing, Croesus, that was yours3
while Ι still have all that I had. Bare was I: so
am Ι now. Ι had nothing: and that I still have.''
The king replied : ‘⁶ Ι wanted for nothing when you,
you beggar, laeked everything; and do I lack if I
need nothing now? ”

3 Daughter of Icarius, who hanged herself through grief

for her father’s death.
