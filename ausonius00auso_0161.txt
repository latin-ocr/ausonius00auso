O FLOWER of our youths and your father's fair
hope, though not your country’s abiding possession,
Alethius the Rhetorician! In earliest- years you
were a teaeher: at an age when it would have been
no disgrace for you, a stripling, to have been learn-
ing still, ere you were come to manhood's estate,
” you were already held even a master equal to your
father, and, afterwards, to Patera. He, with the·
brilliance of his renox'vn and gifts, enriched the walls
of haughty Rome: you, greater than either, were
content to lead on the bright banners of a company 1
in your native town, Bordeaux. You had every
blessing Fate can give, but witha} felt the tooth of
·her eruel jealousy. For Fortune, too early ripe,
gave you every gift and then snatched them away—-
your rhetoric, denied the fruit of mature age3 your
‘brilliant marriage marred by your father's restless-
‘ness; the wealth of your line and your wife's left
’ without heir. Even as the grass of midsummer,
you were but displayed2 and snatched away at
once, frustrating your friends' hopeS, and were en-
riched with goods that would not endure. With
what prophetie utterance is that verse of Horace3
fraught:

“Nothing there is that is wholly blessed.''
