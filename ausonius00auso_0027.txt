INTRODUCTION

1-2) : the senii-historical interest of these poenis lias
already been alluded to (pp. vii. f). The Professores
is a similar collection of memorial verses, though
distinguished by greater metrical variety, and
commemorates the public teachers of the University ’
of Bordeaux. A reference to the execution of
Euchrotia with the Priscillianist martyrs (v, 37)
shows that the work was not finished earlier than
385 A.D. Here again, if we except the verses on
Nepotianus (Prqf'. xv.), Ausonius’ verse is more
interesting as a document for social history than
as poetry. The Epimth a series of epigrams on the
chief heroes of the Trojan War‚ was fiuished after the
Professores and appended to it, as the author himself
states, owing to the similarity of the two works in
tone. The presence of the miscellaneous epitaphs
which follow will be explained below (p. xxxvi.)

The Genetlzliaeos (Epist. xxi), a letter of con-
gratulation to his grandson Ausonius on the occasion
of his fifteenth birthday, may be dated c. 387 A.D.

At this point mention must be made of the
Eplzemeris, the date of which is by no means clear,
though it has been variously fixed at c. 368 and
c. 379-380. It is not easy to decide whether the
poet was writing in the city (i.e. at Treves) or in the
country (Aquitaine): the former is suggested by
iv. 4 ff, v. 3, the latter by viii. 42 f. Consequently
the period to which the composition is to be
assigned is doubtf‘ul : probably, however, it was late 3
