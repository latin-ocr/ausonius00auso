THE MASQUE OF THE SEVEN SAGES

Μελέτη τὸ πᾶν, 'tis the saw of Periander the Corin-
thian,1 who considers that careful thought can
achieve the whole. Ἄριστον μέτρον, says Cleobulus
of Lindosz2 that is, “moderation is always best.'’
But Thales produced ἐγγύα, πάρα δ’ ἄτα 3 and forbids
us to stand surety, because to be a bondsman is ruin.
Money—lenders do not like us to give this advice.

⁷2 I have said my say: Ι will retire. Lawgiver
Solon enters.

IV .—SOLON

AFTER the Greek fashion I appear upon the stage,
Solon, to whom among the Seven Sages the general
voice has given the palm. But the general voice has
not the strictness of the judgment-seat3 for I regard
myself not as the first, but one of them, because
equality cannot brook gradation. When a fool once
asked who was the first among the Sages, well did
the Delphic god advise him to fasten a slip bearing
their names about a round ball, that no one should
be first or last. From that circle's midst I, Solon,
come forward, in order that that word, which it is
thought Ι spake to Croesus, all the human race may
regard as spoken to itself. In Greek 'tis tei-sely put
ὅρα τέλος μακροῦ βίου, but becomes somewhat longer
if rendered in your tongue: Ι bid all men watch
life’s end. Therefore avoid calling men wretched
or happy, because they are always in an uncertain
state. The case stands thus. If I can, I will speak
briefly.4
