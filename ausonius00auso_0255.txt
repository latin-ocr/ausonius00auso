THE ECLOGUES

Or of those twin celebrations—that which they
call Neptunalia,1 and that which is named after
Consus and good counsel ? Of this festival which is
celebrated with naval battles, or that with char-iot-
races, which unite the Romans and their neigh—
bour-chiefs? Shall I tell also of the festivals and
rites of strange gods introduced into Rome, of the
birthday of Hercules or the day2 of the Bark of
Isis, and also the nierry rites of Flora3 held 111 the
licentioris theatre—rites which they long to see who
declare they never longed to see them? Now also
the ancient games called Equiria4 are held ε ’tis 1116
chief name known to the Roman circus. The
Dionysiae Games Rome also keeps under a Latin
name, the same which Liber claims as consecrate to
111111361Ρ.5 The aediles also of the plebs and curule
aediles observe the feast called Sigillaria.6 And
that gladiators once fought out funerary battles in
the forum is well known& now the arena claims
as its own proper prey those who towards the end
of December appease with their blood the sickle-
bearing Son of Heavenss
