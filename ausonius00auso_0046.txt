to Gregorius in Z and begins l. 9 “exemplo confide
meo''; whereas in V it is addressed to Hesperius
and substitutos “ exemplum iam patris habes.'‘ And
of the remaining three pieces ii. is found in Γ only,
iii. and iv. in Z only.

The Technopaegnion affords yet more striking in-
stances of variation between Z and Γ. The original
dedication to Paulinus (Ten-lm. ii.) is found in Z
alone, the later dedication to Pacatus (Techn. i.) in
1⁷ only ε of the sections in this work that on Mono-
syllabic Letters (Teclm. xiii.) occurs in Γ, but not in Ζ,
while the texts of the two groups show well-marked
differences. Thus in x. 26 Z has “ nota et parvorum
cunis ’' which is changed in V into “ nota Caledoniis
nuribus ''; for xiv. :3 (according to V) Z reads
“ et quod nonnunquam praesumit laetificum gaus
placing this after xiv, 193 and for xiv. 5f. (of V) Z
has the single line “scire velim Catalepta legens
quid significet tau.'' Lastly and most significantly
(if we remember the alternative prcfaces) V has
“indulge Pacate bonus¹⁷ in xiv. 21 in place of the
“indulge Pauline bonus '’ of Z. These variants can
only'be due to deliberate revision on the part of
the autlior3 in other words the matter connnon to
Z and V follows one edition in the former group,
and another in the latter. Peiper's theory of a single
archetype consequently collapses.

It has been necessaryv to dwell on this matter at
some length for the following reason. Owing
primarily to an error of judglnent on the part of the
