PERSONAL POEMS

father. It is a title consecrated by Greek writers to
the honour of the departed, and is expressive not of
vanity but of devotion. And this poem Ι commend
to my reader, be he son, or father, or both. Ι (10 not
demand that he should praise it, but I do ask him to
love it. And indeed Ι do not here sing the praises
of my father-3 for he needs no praise, and I have no
right to burden the dead with the entertainment ot
the living. F urthermore, Ι say nothing more of
him than what those who were to some degree his
contemporaries recognize as fact. For me to say
what is untrue about him because he is dead, and
to disguise what is true, I consider to be equally
heinous. These verses were written under his por—
trait, and likewise entered in the collection of my
works. Ι am dissatisfied with all else of mine3 but
this poem I love to read over and over again.

My name was Ausonius, of no mean repute in
the art of healing3 nay, if you but knew my age,
I ‚was the foremost. Ι was born and had my
dwelling in two neighbouring towns3 Bazas was my
birthplace, but Bordeaux was my home. I was a
senator in the couneill of both towns, although l
filled no office and my rank was honorary. Not
wealthy nor yet needy, I lived thriftily yet not
meanly: as to my table, dress, and habits, I have
always followed the same way. For Latin I never
had a ready tongue3 but the speech of Athens
supplied my need with words of choice eloquence.
To all who asked I brought the aid of my art with-
out fee, and pity bare a large share in my work.

² Every municipimn had a senate of one hundred members
(decuriones) who met in a eouneil-chamber called curia.
