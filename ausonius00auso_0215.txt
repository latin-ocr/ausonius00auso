way finding Nepos, presented it to him. But this
ugly,1·ough little book—junk, trash, and drivelling
——to whose bosom shall Ι commit it to be cherished?
I have it! (Peace, my anxious triflesl) ’Tis one
not less learned and more generous than he with

fondle you, he to guard you ; he will hide away your
shortcomings, will pass on what he approves: after
him, fear ye no critic Ῐ F arewell.
