THE MASQUE OF THE SEVEN SAGES

9¹ The king or despot of Lydia, Croesus, was one
of these “ happy '' men, extravagantly rich, one who
used to give the gods temples built of golden bricks.l
He summoned me abroad. I come, obeying his com-
mand that so the Lydians may be able to enjoy a
better king. He asks: let me name a happy man,
if Ι know one. Ι speak of Τ61163,2 110 1116311 citizen:
he had offered up 1113 life fighting for his country.
He scorned this man—asks for another. I found one,
Aglaus ;3 116 had never gone outside the bounds of
his little farm. But 116 asks, laughing: ‘⁶ Ι11 what
place, then, do you put 1116, who alone am called
happy by the whole world? '' “ We must behold,''
Ι answer, “the end of life first: then we can judge
-if prosperity abides.'' Croesus took the saying
badly: I leave the king. He plans war against the
Persians. He marched, was beaten, bound, handed
over to their king. He stands, trying to imagine his
own end, while fire was spreading all round about
and rolling aloft on its 111331 clouds of smoke.
Almost too late, Croesus with a deep cry says: «O
true seer 1 O Solon, Solon! '² With 3 great clamour he
calls on Solon thrice. Moved by this utterance Cyrus
bids the encircling fire be put out and the blazing
pyre pulled down3 and happily a shower, poured
from the clouds, quenched the flames. Croesus is
straightway led to the king by 3 picked band of
soldiers: he is asked whom he meant by Solon, and
what reason he had for calling his name aloud?
From first to last he relates all to the king. Cyrus
feels pity, and seeing Fortune's power, praises Solon:

¹ See Herodotus, i. 50. Croesus sent 170 “ bricks ³² of gold
tO²Dle1llellerodotuffi i. 30, he is called Tellos.
³ See Valerius Maximus, vn. i. 2.
