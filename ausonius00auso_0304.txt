AUSONIUS

hic habuit decimo celebrata volumine Marcei
hebdomas, hic clari viguere Menecratis artes

atque Ephesi spectata manus vel in arce Minervae
Ictinus, magico cui noctua perlita fuco

adlicit omne genus volucres perimitque tuendo. 310
conditor hic forsan fuerit Ptolomaidos aulae
Dinochares, quadrata cui in fastigia cono

surgit et ipsa suas consumit pyramis umbras,

iussus ob incesti qui quondam foedus amoris
Arsinoen Pharii suspendit in aere templi. 315
spirat enim tecti testudine virus achates

adflatamque trahit ferrato crine puellam.

Hos ergo aut horum similes est credere dignum
Belgarum in terris scaenas posuisse domorum,
molitos celsas fluvii decoramina villas. 320
haec est natura sublimis in aggere saxi,

1 Marcus Terentius Varro produced between c. 60-40 Ro.
a work in fifteen volumes (one introductory)‚ known as
Imagyines or Hebdomades. It contained portraits and brief
notrices of nearly seven hundred famous personages, Romans
and foreigners. The title Hebdomades was due to the plan
of the actual work which consisted of fourteen volumes (or
two hebdomades), and each volume of seven groups of seven
personages each. Apparently one such group was devoted
to the seven greatest architectS.

² No famous architect of this name is known. It is pro-
bable that Ausonius has unconsoiously or deliberately sub-
stituted this name for the metrically impossible Metagenes,
who with his father Chersiphron, or Ctesiphon, built the
fourth-century temple of Artemis at Ephesus.

²³ sc, Chersiphron (or Ctesiphon) : see preceding note.

⁴ Ictinus was the architect of the Parthenon. Nothing
further is known of t-he remarkable owl, which seems to have
been furnished with eyes so lifelike as to fascinate the birds.
