CUPID CR UCIFIED

of love for Lesbian Phaon, threatens to leap from
cloud-wrapped Leucas, Sad Eriphylel refuses the
necklace of Harmonia, unhappy in her son and
luckless 111 1161· husband. Here also the whole story
of Minos and aery Crete glimmers like some faint—
limned pictured scene. Pasiphae follows the foot-
steps of her snow-white 111111, forlorn Ariadne carries
a ball of twine in her hand, hopeless Phaedra looks
back at the tablets '3 she has 6351 away. This wears
a halter, this the empty semblance of a crown, while
this hesitates in 51131116 10 611161· 1161· hiding-place
in the heifer wrought by Daedalus. Laodamia?-
cries out on those two nights passed all too soon in
unreal joys, 0116 with her living lord, one with her
dead. Elsewhere, fierce with drawn swords all,
stand Thisbe and Canace and Sidonian Elissa: this
carries 1161· 1111511311(1’5 1113116, that her f'ather's, and
the third her guest's. She also wanders here, even
as of old o'er Latmus' rocks when she was wont to
woo 1116 slumbering Endymion‚—-twy—horned Luna
with her torch and starry diadem. A hundred
more besides, renewing vthe wounds of their old
passions‚ revive their pangas with plaints both sweet
and sad.

45 Into the midst of these Love rashly broke
scattering the darkness of that murky gloom witl-
rustling wings. All recognized the boy, and as their
thoughts leapt 113611, they knew him for the one
transgressor against them all, though the damp
clouds obscured the 5116611 of his golden-studded

3 Daughter of Acastus and wife of Protesilaus. She ob—
tained from the gods the favour that Protesilaus, to whom
she had been wedded only one (lay before he 561 forth to fall
at Troy, should be permitted to return for a few hours 10
the earth : see lVordsworth’s Laodamia.
