PREFATORY PIECES

to Grammar, and then to Rhetoric‚ wherein Ι gained
sufficient skill. Ι frequented the Courts as well,
' but preferred to follow the business of teaching‚ and
won some repnte as a grammarian3 and though my
renown was not of so high a degree as to approach
that of Aemilius,1 or Scaurus,2 or Probus of Beyrfit33
yet it was high enough to let me look upon the
teachers of my day, men famous in Aquitaine, as
their equal rather than their inferior.

23 Afterwards, when three decades with all their
festivals were passed, I left my toils as a provincial
teacher, receiving the command to enter the Em-
peror’s golden palace. There I taught the young
prince Grammar, and in due time Rhetoric3 for, in-
deed, Ι have good reason for satisfaction and my
boasting rests upon firm ground. Yet I confess that
there have been tutors of greater fame, so but 'tis
granted that there has been to none a nobler pupil.
Alcaeus‘ offspring was taught by Atlas, and the son
of Aeacus by Chiron 4—the first Jove’s own son, and
the other well-nigh sprung from Jove—and these
had Thebes and Thessaly for their homes. But this
my pupil reigns over the whole world, which is his
own. He created me Companion and Quaestor? and
crowned my honours with the prefectship of the pro-
vinces of Gaul, Libya, and Italy.6 I became consul,7

prime 56—57 A. D. ‚ and calls him eruditissimus qrcmzmatz'corum.
He is perhaps confused here with the later (second century)
Probus, the editor of Virgil. 4 Hercules and Achilles.

Wissowa‚ ReaZ-Encyclopc'cdie, iv.: in this instance it seems to
have been a purely honorary title. ⁶ In 378. ⁷ In 379.
