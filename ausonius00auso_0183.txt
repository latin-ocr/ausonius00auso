GRAMMARIANS

YoUR name also, Crispus, shall be kept in memory
by this sad lanient which I offer you, and go down to
future ages-*you who used to teach the youngest
boys, unskilled in speech, the simple signs of their
new task, the alphabet: at times it was thought
that you used to prime yourself with wine in order
to produce verse rivalling passages of Vergil and of
Flaccus.

10 For you also, Urbicus, held of less account for
Latin themes, though famous for your Greek, thus
will I raise a chant of grief. For in the company of
your friend Crispus you would pour out a flood of
words in prose and verse with equal ease and with
such eloquence as to remind us of those heroes sung
by old Homerl——that son of Pleisthenes, so sweet
but terse, and the impetuous lord of Dulichium2
whose words were as {lakes of snow, and Nestor the
king, whose melodious speech was sweet of utterance
with the nectar of his honeyed lips.

25 Both ready speakers, both learned in all the
lore of poe'sy, and skilled alike in mythic fictions and
in history, you were both freedmen by birth, but in
your natures such as might well have deserved to be
called the sons of free—born fathers.
