PARENTALIA

Alpine heights. But trouble, all toojealous of lineage
and proud wealth, weighed heavy upon him ; for my
grandfather and his father were proscribed when
Victorinus1 was holding sway as prince, and when
the supreme power passed into the hands of the two
T etrici.2 Then, while in exile in the lands through
which the Adour breaks forth to the sea, and where
wild Ocean rages on the shore of Tarbellae (Dax),
though still he feared the arrows of Fortune who so
long had sought his life, he was united in marriage
with penniless Aemilia. In time a scanty suin gathered
with great pains furnished his wearied age with some
relief, though not with wealth. You—though you
cloaked your pursuitS—-had skill in the measures of
the heavens and in the stars which keep the secret
of man's destiny. Not unknown to you was the out-
line of my life, which you had hidden in a sealed
tablet, and never betrayed3 but my mother's forward
care revealed that which the care of my shy grand-
father sought to conceal. When you had lived a life
of ninety years, you found how to be dreaded are
the arrows of the goddess Chanee, and wounded by
her shaft, mourned for a son, lost in his thirtieth
year—a death which blotted the light out of your
life. Yet you would say that some consolation-J ἲ
though far remote, cheered you, because high dis-
tinction awaited my destiny. And now that you join
in the assemblies of souls that are gone before,
surely you have knowledge of your grandson's for-
tunes: you feel that a quaestor, that a prefect, and
likewise a consul am I who now commemorate you
with a tribute in your honour.

² The Tetrici (father and son) succeeded Victorinus.
