PARENTALIA

XI.——PAsTOR, Μγ SON's CHILD

Yon also, lad of unripe years, have broken this
sequence of laments for riper age, Pastor, my loved
grandson, filling with bitter grief your grandfather,
whose sure hope you would have been, third child
of Hesperius your father. Your name, which chance
had given you (because just when you were born a
pipe sounded some pastoral air), too late was under-
stood to be a symbol of your short life: because
the breath soon passes from the pipes on which a
shepherd blows. You perished stricken down by
the weight of a cast tile, thrown from the roof by
a workman's hand. No workman's hand was that:
that hand of bloody F ate should surely have borne
the blame. Ah me, how many of my hopes, how
many of my joys you broke short, my Pastor!
That tile, carelessly flung, reached my head. O,
how much fitter were you to mourn the end of
my old age, and raise a sad lament at my burial!

§HL—„Imm DRYADIA, MY SlsTER

IF there is any virtue which a discreet woman
could desire to possess, Dryadia, my sister, lacked
it not. Nay more, she had many which the stronger
sex and the nobler heart of men would gladly
have. Well trained with her distaff's aid to main-
tain her life and her good name, and trained in
all good habits, she trained her household too.
To her truth was dearer than life, and her one
thought was to know God and to love her brother
