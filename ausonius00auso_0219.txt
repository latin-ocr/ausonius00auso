THE ECLOGUES

us to keep faith. Live your life and always practise
friendship : that was the very charge which destroyed
the learned college of the Pythagorean sages.1 F ear-
ing this end, then, make no friendships: that was
the very charge on which Timon was stoned of old
in Athens, dear to Pallas. Conflicting wishes ever
beset and distract our hearts, nor is it enough for a
man that things are as he wished3 for what he once
longed to have, he now refuses. His heart is set on
rank and dignities, but presently he regrets his
wish: he is content to obey, that he may command
one day: he rises to high station, and straightway
is exposed to envy. Learning costs sleepless nights
of toil; yet ignorance lacks all that makes life fair.
Become a pleader and defend the accused: you will
find it rare to get a thankful client. Well, be a client
then: you cannot bear your patron’s domineering

ways. A man prays earnestly to become a father: ,

soon, harsh cares and anxieties steal upon him. Yet,
on the other hand, childless old age is scorned3 and he
who lacks heirs is the fortune-hunter’s prey. Should
you live sparingly, people will tear your character to
rags for a miser. Be prodigal, and you will incur a
heavier charge. All paths in life confront you with
unfavourable issues. Therefore the opinion of the
Greeks is wisest 3 for they say that it is good for a man
not to be born at all, or, being born, to die quickly.

5¹ [Such‚2 at least,> is the Pythagorean pronounce-
ment as expressed in the following couplet :

“The first and greatest boon is never to be born z
Thel lliext3 to pass through Hades’ gates without
e ay.

2 The following refutation of the Pythagorean view of
life appears to have been added by a crit-ic who took his
Christianity more seriously than did Ausonius.
