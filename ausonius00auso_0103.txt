PERSONAL POEMS

robe that distinguishes the Roman consul. Lo, how
my honours are increased (hear this, O NemesiS,
with an indulgent ear): Augustus deigns to appear
as consul after me. It is as though he did more
than rank me with himself now he has bidden me
to bear the insignia before himself.

Come, Janus ; come, Nem Year; come, Sun, with
strength renewed !

50 Cause the one Tropic to give place to the Sun
and again, make that other flee3 that twice he (the
Sun) may move through his changes from the Tropic
Star and four times hasten to pass on from the three
grouped signs} Urge on the summer days, and let
Caesar's promised year speed the winter with its
laggard nights. If Ι behold that year, then shall Ι be
thrice, nay four times blessed ; then shall Ι be doubly
consul, then my head shall touch heaven itself.

VL—ANoTHER PRAYER Fon THE FmsT oF JANUARY

Yam, that beginnest with good augury, thou dost
behold the opening of Ausonius’ consulship. Show
forth thy fiery head, eterna] Sun, and shine more
brilliantly than is thy wont, spreading a glowing
beam of light from out the East. O Year, who art
the father of all those things which thou dost roll
onv‘vard from the month of twy-faced J anus to wintry
December's icy close, come, gracious New Year,
and on the heels of the Old Year bring in merry
J anuary. Drive through thy gates the twelve months

¹ A close rendering seems impossible. The two Tropics
(of Cancer and capricorn) are to be quickly passed (cedere
. . . terya dare), that the Sun may run his due course be-

tween the two Tropic Stars and the four groups (of three
Signs each) which mark the seasons, and so bring the year to

a close.
