THE ECLOGUES

Sun first makes strong influence felt, and, streaming
in, causes the soft foetus to solidify. And with its
fire his triangular aspect 1 flashes an enlivening glow,
beaming bright and mild—that aspect which at the
threshold of the fifth sign beats upon the mother,
astonished at the quickened life within her. For in
the sixth House the Sun has no power at all, because
for Phoebus no line of sight is marked forming a
side of any equal-sided figure. But when he has
accomplished half his progress through the starry
company, and moved his blazing camp across the
frontiers of the seventh House, then he looks upon
the ever-growing embryo with a direct aspect and in
full flood of light3 then he pours down his beams
upon it without stint and warnis it with all the
heat of his fiery crown. And the reason why
Lucina sometimes comes before the appointed hour
of travail, and why she who is with child feels the
pangs of labour stealing over her before the time
awaited with prayers, is that, had he not shaken the
reluctant bars restraining birth at the time when he
poured his light from the place of the seventh sign,
the Sun could not afterwards effect what he could
have done before. Or can this be the cause, that
the ineffective glance of the eighth planet, as of the
sixth, cannot form any equal-sided figure? But when γ
116 occupies the ninth sign, he brings relief to the
long-drawn prayers of mothers, the resultant triangle 1
joining its power with his. Yet if perverse Ilithyia
tarries once again, he will break through the bonds
of hesitation and delay when he passes on to assume
his quadrilatera] aspect (in the tenth sign).
