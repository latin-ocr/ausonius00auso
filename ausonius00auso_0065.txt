THE DAILY ROUND

17 Up with you, you waster! What a thrashing
you deserve! “Up, or a long, long sleep will come
on you from where you dread it least.'’ 1 Oui: with
you, Parmeno, from your downy bed !

²12-Perchance this ditty, tuned to the Sapphic
mode, encourages your sleep? Come you then,
brisk Iambus, and banish hence the restful Lesbian
strain.

IL—Tm: INTERLUDE

H1, boy 1 Get up! Bring me my slippers and my
tunic of lawn: bring all the clothes that you have
ready now for my going out. F etch me spring water
to wash my hands and mouth and eyes. Get me the
chapel opened, but with no outward display: holy
words and guiltless prayers are furniture enough for
worship. I do not call for incense to be burnt nor
for any slice of honey-cake: hearths of green turf
I leave for the altars of vain gods. I must pray
to God and ’co the Son of God most high, that
co—equal 2 Majesty united in one fellowship with the
Holy Spirit. And lo, now I begin my prayers: my
heart feels Heaven is near and trembles. Have saith
and hope, then, anything to sear ?
