THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

XVIII.—To MARCELLUS, SoN or MARCELLUS,
’ THE GRAMMARIAN OF NAnssoNNE

Ι wn,L not pass you by without a word, Marcellus,
son of Marcellus. The harshness of your mother
drove you from your home and your city, but all-
powerful Fortune soon restored all you had lost
and added more. For firstly, in Narbo you found
the country you had lost3 and here Clarentius, a
stranger of high birth, was led by your noble nature
to give you his daughter to wife. And in due time
your classes and lectures, thronged with crowds of
boys, brought you the title of grammarian and
wealth. But Fortune never favours a career of un-
varying success, especially when she finds a man
of a crooked nature. Howbeit, ’tis not for me to
make heavier your destiny: my task is to recall
it. lt is enough to say that you lost all at one
stroke3 yet not your title also, whereof I do not rob
you, but give you a place amongst grammarians of
very scant deserving.

xlx—SEDATUS, THE Ram-omma* oF TOULOUSE

ΙΤ were a thing unholy to leave you unmentioned,
Sedatus, although it was abroad that you obtained
your post as teacher. We had one native place, you
and Ι; but the hazards of all-powerful Destiny gave
you a chair at Toulouse. There you found a wife,
and children, and riches for your old age, with such
renown as is the due of a great rhetorician. Yet
from that land, however far, your native place now
brings you home, and after death claims you again
