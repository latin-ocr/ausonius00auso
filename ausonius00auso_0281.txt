THE MOSELLE ¹

I ΗΑΒ crossed over swift-flowing Nava’s cloudy
stream, and gazed with awe upon the ramparts lately
thrown round ancient Vincum,'2 where Gaul once
matched the Roman rout at Cannae, and where her
slaughtered bordes lay scattered over the country-
side untended and unwept.3 Thence onward Ι began
a lonely journey through pathless forest, nor did my
eyes rest on any trace of human inhabitants. I passed
Dumnissus‚4 sweltering amid its parched fields, and
Tabernae,⁵ watered by its unfailing spring, and the
lands lately parcelled out to Sarmatian settlers.‘-'‘
And at length on the very verge of Belgio territory
Ι descry Noiomagus, the famed camp of sainted
Constantine] Clearer the air which here invests
the plains, and Phoebus, cloudless now, discloses
glowing heaven with his untroubled light. No
longer is the sky to seek, shut out by the green
gloom of branches intertwined z but the free breath

Constantius Chlorus (ix. and xxi.) refers to such a settlement
of Chamavi and Frisii3 and Maximian populatcd the waste
lands of the Nervii and Treveri with Letts and Franks.
This was c. 293-14 A.D. Ausonius clearly refers to s: later
settlement.

⁷ Noiomagus or Noviomagus, the modern Neumagen, was
probably occupied by Constantine in his war with the Franks
and Alamanni, between 306 and 312 A.D.: cp. Eutropius,
Brev. Χ. iii. 2.
