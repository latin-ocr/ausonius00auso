PARENTALIA

sad offerings ordained by our fathers, this effort to
raise a tearful lament, cast in a woeful strain which
in his grief your uncle presents to you.

XVIII.-F1,Avius SANCTUS, HUSBAND oF PUDENTlLLA,
THE Sls'rER oF MY erss SAmNA

YoU, Sir, who love jests and merriment, you who
hate all moroseneSS, neither fearing any man nor
causing any man to fear, who entrap no man by
trickery nor vex him at the law, but mildly and
wisely live an upright life, come with reverent lips
and words of good omen to do honour to the peace-
ful shade and the remains of kindly Sanctus, His
service1 he performed diligently without tumult ;
with him for governor the Rutupian land rejoiced;
his eighty years a peaceful old age marred not with
any day of decline. Therefore be this your pro-
pitious prayer, that Sanctus may enjoy such peace
among the shades as he found in the season of his

life.

XIX-Ninum PUDENT1LLA, MY SISTEss-m—LAW

Yon also, Lady, who think highly of a good name
and upright life, speak a word of last farewell to
Pudentilla. Well—born, thrifty, and upright, cheerful,
modest, and fair, she shared without a break the
wedded life of Sanctus. Keeping unstained the
praises due to a modest life, she managed her own
property, while her lord lived at ease: but for all
that she did not taunt her husband nor look black
upon him because he left a woman to manage the

borough (Rutupiae) was in t-he command of the “Count of
the Saxon Shore,” but Rutupinus aqer here denotes Britain.
