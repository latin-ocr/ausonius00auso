INTRODUCTION

were the themes in which Ausonius delighted: the
Parentalia and the illosellffl indeed, are notable
exceptions; but even in these the mania for versified
lists manifests itself, here in a complete catalogue of
the poet's relatives, there in an exact enumeration of
the fishes to be found in the stream.

But if we could admit for a moment that these and
similar matters were legitimate objects for poetic
treatment, we should also have to admit that Ausonius
was a master of his craft. The skill displayed in
working out the unpromising theme of the Griphus
has already been noticed, and it is exerted to the full
in the impossible task of making palatable the
Teclmopaegnion. Ausonius, indeed, brought to his
task many qualities and accomplishments which a
brighter genius might have envied : his acquaintance
with the letter, if not with the spirit, of classic authors
was intimate ; his meinory was clearly of unusual
strength, as the quotations or reminiscences occurring
on almost every page will show ; and his rhetorical skill
stands him in good stead in his more ambitious works,
the fisos-elle and Γειρὲιί (Ινιιερβἰεᾶ. The peroration of the
former (ll. 3846& may indeed be singled out as a
really impressive example of this art. To these he
adds the half-poetical, half-rhetorical gift for epigram
—as when he writes of Tiberius (Caesares, Tetr. iii. 4),

quae prodit vitiis credit operta locis,
or of Otho (id. viii. 1),

hoc solum fecit nobile quod pe1·iit;
