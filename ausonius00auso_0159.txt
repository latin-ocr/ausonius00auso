THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

like a raging flood, you strung together an epic
all in verse more rapidly than any man free from
the handicap of prosody could shape as much in
prose. In divers fields your eloquence achieved
renown, until its fame stood as high abroad as
here at home3 now when you appeared before the
prefect of the pretorian cohort, and now in the
presence of the provincial judges when you were
briefed to defend the threatened honour or the life
of the accused. How happy had you been had you
pursued the Muses' tasks amid the peaceful toil of
letters3 had not the impulse of revenge armed the
hatred which great lawsuitsl breed3 or had you
never sought to climb up to the unrestful Palace in
the days of tyranny l 2 While you ever conjured up
far-distant hope, disdaining that which lay in your
way, and preferred success to be your work rather
γ than Fate's, you lost full much, wandering through
all the empty titles of distinction and deserving
greater prizes than you won. Hence arose the
crushing charges which ensued, though your father's
sorrow won your pardon. Thereafter you became
a rhetorician3 but lack of diligence in teaching dis-
appointed the hopes of your pupil's fathers. It was
by the grace of God you suffered no worse ill, but
were carried off in middle age and spared the pain
of your daughter's perversity and the execution of
your wife.3
