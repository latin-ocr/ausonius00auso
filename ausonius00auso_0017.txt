his advancement became rapid and his influence very
marked. His hand, for instance, has been traoed in
the legislation of this period (see Cod. Theod. xiii. 3.
ll, xv, l. 19 and cp. Seeck, Symmachus, p. lxxix.)
In his rise the soaring professor drew a train of rela-
tives after him. His father, then nearly 90 years of
age, was granted the honorary rank of prefect of
Illyricum in 375 A.D. (Dom. iv. 52); his son Hesperius
was proconsul of Africa in 376 ΑΛ). and praefectus
praetorio of Italy, Illyricum and Africa in 377—3SO;
his son-in-law, Thalassius, succeeded Hesperius in the
proeonsulship of Africa3 while a nephew‚ Aemilius
Magnus Arborius, was appointed comes rerum privat—
arum in 379 A.D. and promoted prstqfhclvus urbi in the
year following. Ausonius himself was raised to the
splendid post of praefectus Galliarum in 378, the office
being united by special arrangement with the pre-
fecture of Hesperius to enable father and son to share
between them the toils and rewards of both posts.
But the crowning honour was reserved for 379 A.D.‚
when the ex-professor attained the consulship—an
absorbing theme discussed from all its bearings in the
Gratiarum Actio. At the close of 379 A.D. Ausonius
retired to Bordeaux (Domestica i. ι title), no doubt to
take possession of the ancestral estate which had
come to him on the death of his father in 378 Ap.
But in 383 the mainspring of the family fortunes
was rudely broken. The ¹army in Britain revolted
with Maximus at its head: Treves was occupied,
Gratian slain at Lyons, Valentinian ΙΙ. driven out of
