THE MOSELLE

yet your noble and stately verse has upset my pre-
conceptions and made this stream for me greater
than the Nile of Egypt, cooler than the Don oi
Scythia, and inore famous than this Tiber we all
know so well. I should certainly not believe all the
great things you say of the source of the Moselle and
its How, did I not know that you never tell a lie—
even in poetry. How did you discover all those
shoals of river-fish, whose names are no less varied
than their hues, whose size differs as widely as their
flavour—qualities which are painted in your poem in
colours more glowing than any Nature gave? And
yet, though Ι have often found myself at your table
and there have marvelled at most other articles
of food which at the time were highly esteemed, I
have never found there fish such as you describe.
Tell me: when were these fish spawned which
appear in your book, but did not upon your board?
You think Ι am jesting and merely trifling? So
may Heaven make me honest, as I rank your poem
with the works of Virgil!

But it is time Ι ceased to dwell upon your praises,
forgetting my own vexation3 otherwise you may wrest
the fact that Ι admire your work despite my annoy-
ance into an additional tribute. You may spread
abroad copies of your poems and always leave me
out; but Ι will enjoy your work all the same, though
it be through the kindness of others. Farewell.
