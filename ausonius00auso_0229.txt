THE ECLOGUES

In the same way the pound is a solid whole, for it
consists of twelve equal parts, and 111 111636 equal
parts, small though they are, one virtue always
abides. For if aught is subtracted from their sum,
the total is impaired, the parts are thrown out of
place and fall because the frame is ruined. As, if we
were to wrench out from an arch the keystone upon
which all the voussoirs1 bear, the rest will follow
suit and come to the ground, their general downfall
caused by the topmost stone 3 even so is it with the
pound. If one ounce is wanting, it will no longer
be a pound, but being short in weight will be called
deuna· (eleven-twelfths). The dextans (five-sixths)‚ too,
does not retain that name if a sextans (one-sixth) be
taken from it, and the dodrans (three-quarters) will
be left without the author of its being if we subtract
the quadrans (one—fourth). So, 100, 1116 bessis (two-
thirds) cannot endure once the triens (one-third) is
torn from it. Take away one 361111116,2 and you will
have no quincunae (five-twelfths) left you. And how
can 1116 semis (one-half) be a half if the fractions 01
1116 pound thus waste away? And of what pound
will the septunx (seven-twelfths) stand for seven
parts? That is a pound, then, which is impaired
in 110 single part. Weight and number, character,
tasks, and waters—all have a libra 3: there is no form
of regulation which you may not mark with this
name. There is a libra of the earth, which hangs in
mid-air, and a libra of their own controls the paths

light of Pliny, who (NH. ii. 27) quotes Pytheas of Mar-
seilles as stating that in Britain 1116 tide rises 80 cubits
above the level of 1116 1311(1. This phenomenon, too, is 10 be
explained 011 1116 theory of a natural poise or balance. The
libret (l. 33) of the poet's character is doubtloss 1116 good
influenee of his friend which keeps him “ upright.”
