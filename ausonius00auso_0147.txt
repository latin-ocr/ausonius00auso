Wm: oF JU111ANUS CENSOR

Unmm, famed both for illustrious birth and old-
time virtues, and renowned as Censor's wife, rich as
was the store of your natural qualities, you have
added those besides which your sponse 'caught yon,
and your father and your mother—those qualities
which Tanaquil1 possessed, and Theano the Pytha-
gorean,2 and those which perished without copy
when you1 husband died. And had Fate suffered
you so to exchange‚ Censor would still be living in
these our days. Yet not for long did you suffer grief
in your widowed state, but welcomed death nand
straightway followed your husband to the shades.
Now I, Ausonius, your fellow parent-in-law, with my
son-in-law3 and his children, bring you your yearly
due with sad lanient.

² A female disciple or, according to some, the wife of
Pythagoras, famous both for wisdom and virtue.

³ sc. Thalassius, son of Julianus Censor and Urbica, who
had married a daughter (Ausonia ‘?) of Ausonius.
