days. Ι tear my grey hairs mocked by my widowed
life, and the more I live in loneliness, the more
I live in heaviness. That my house is still and
silent, and that my bed is cold, that I share νΠοῖ
my ills with any, my good with any—these things
feed my wound. I grieve‚ if one man has a worthy
wife3 and yet again Ι grieve if another has a bad:
for pattern, you are ever present with me. Howe'er
it be, you come to torture me: if one be bad, be-
cause you were not like her; or if one be good,
because you were like her. Ι mourn not for use-
less wealth or unsubstantial joys, but because in
your youth you were torn from me, your youthful
lord. Cheerful, modest, staid, famed for high birth
as famed for beauty, you were the grief and glory
of Ausonius your spouse. For ere you could complete
your eight and twentieth December, you deserted
our two children, the pledges of our love. They by
God's mercy, and as you ever prayed, flourish amid
an abundance of such goods as you desii-ed for them.
And still Ι pray that they may prosper, and that at
last my dust may bring the news to your ashes that
they are living yet.

X.——-Ausomus, ΜΥ SoN, A LITTLE CfflLn

Ι wlLL not leave you unwept, my son, nor rob you
of the complaint due to your memory—you, my
first-born child, and called by my name. Just as
you were practising to transform your babbling into
the first words of childhood and were of ripe natural
gifts we had to mourn for your decease. You on
your great-grandfather's bosom lie sharing one com-
mon grave, lest you should suffer the reproach of
your one lone tomb.
