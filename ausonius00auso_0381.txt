THE MASQUE OF THE SEVEN SAGES

Ι declined and did not accept it, returning it to be
taken to others such as I deemed more eminent.
Then, when to each of the Seven Sages it had been
sent and sent back, they brought it again to me. I
accepted and dedicated it to Apollo; for if Phoebus
bids the Wise One be chosen, 'tis fitting to believe
that not any man but a god is meant.

1⁷5 That man, then, am Ι. But the reason for
my appearing on the stage, as with the two who
have preceded me, is to become the champion of
my own maxim. It will offend some, but not those
canny ones who have learned from experience and
have been made worldly-wise. Well, ἐγγύα, πάρα
δ’ ἄτα, we say in Greek: in your language, “Be
a surety, but Ruin stands near you.1'' Ι could run
over a thousand instances to prove that those who
give bond or bail appear at the bar of regret. But
I do not care to mention anyone by name: let
each of you mention such to himself and reflect how
many have suffered loss and harm by standing surety.
Yet may both parties still find pleasure in this service!

188 Clap, then, some of you; the rest, affronted,
hiss me off the stage.

VIII.—B1As

I AM Bias of Priene, and my saying οἱ πλεῖστοι κακοί
Ι fancy you would render “most men are bad.'' Ι
could wish I had never said it; “ truth breeds hatred.''
But by the “bad'’ I meant uncultured men and
savages, who disregard right and equity and hallowed
customs. For this throng filling the circle of the
theatre is of good men all. It is your enemies'

1 cp. Proverbs, xi. 15: “He that is surety . . . shall
smart for it.'’
