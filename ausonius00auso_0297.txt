sight affords ! They circle in and out, and graze the
sprouting blades of the cropped turs along the green
banks. The husbandman, standing upon the rise of
the green bank, watches the light-hearted owners as
they leap about on stern or prow, the boyish crew
straggling over the river's wide expanse, and never

navies of the Nile and Roman triremes waged below
Leucas and Apollo's hold31 or as when Euboean 2
barks repeat upon the waters of echoing Avernus the
hazards of the strife at Mylae in the Pompeian W⁷a1·;3

green imagery while Sicilian Pelorus 4 looks down 3—

owing to the height of the sun in the heavens. For inversi
