The occasion is celebrated in a short poem On leis
Patrimony (Domesl. 1.). At the close of 379 ΑΛ). he
published the first edition of his Fasti, dedicated to
his son Hesperius. Originally the main part of this
work was a list of the kings and consuls of Rome
from the foundation of the city down to the author‘s
own consulate. The list however, is not extant,l and
all that remains of this production are the short
addresses in verse which accompanied it. A second
edition brought up to date (and probably corrected)
was issued in 383 ΑΛ). with a new dedication to
Gregorius.

Caesares was written at about the same time as

Emperors from Nerva to Commodus3 the second
edition was enlarged by (a) a series of Tetrasticha
on the twelve Caesars, and (b) new Tetrasticha
bringing the list down to the times of Heliogabalus.
