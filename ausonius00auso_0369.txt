THE MASQUE OF THE SEVEN SAGES

IL-Pnomcmss

THE Seven Sages, as an earlier age called them—
nor has a later withdrawn the title—to-day step
forth upon our stage, wearing Grecian cloaks‚ Why
do you blush so hotly, toga-clad Roman, because
such famous men are to appear upon the stage?
With us this is a disgrace, but is not so also with men
of Greece,1 whose theatre serves them in place of a
Senate House. Our proceedings have their own al-
lotted places: the Campus for elections, as the Curia
for the Senate, while the privilege of· the citizens
sets apart the forum and the rost1·a.2 At Athens
and everywhere in Greece the only public place for
debate3 is that which luxury established in our city
at a late date.4 The aedile in old times used to
provide a wooden theatre, hastily run up, and not a
massive pile of stone. That is what Murena and
Gallius ⁵ did—I will mention established facts. When
men, grown powerful and reckless of expense, be-
lieved their names would endure for ever if they
once raised a massy structure on stone foundations
to be a place for shows to all time, this immense

enraged Ephesians of St. Paul's day “ rushed with one accord
into the Theatre '³ (Acts, xix. 29).

⁴ As late as B.C. 154 an attempt to raise a permanent
theatre was thwarted by the senate. The first permanent
stone theatre was built> by Pompey (B.C. 55): that of Cor-
nelius Balbus (l. 40) was erected in Ro. 13, and in the same
year that of Octavian was dedicated in memory of his nephew
Marcellus.

Gallius is mentioned as having given a gladiatorial show when
aedile, professedly in honour of his father: see Asconius
Pedianus, Com-m. in Cic. C. C. Antonius ec L. Catilina.
