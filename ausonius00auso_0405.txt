BOOK XV

CONCLUSION OF THE BOOK OF ANNALS

I.—AUSON1US To ms SoN HESPERIUS, Galam-mo

(To be appe7zo⁷ed to my Book of the Consuls, where I
have compressed into a single volume the names of all
the Consuls. To Gregorius, formerly Prefect.)1

ΤΗΑΤ not unknown to you may be the ages w,hich
eternal Rome has passed under the sway of Princes
and of Senate, Ι have compiled these Annals, gather-
ing the names which Time in his swift career has left
scattered along the path of Latin history. Be yours
this fruit, take the produce of my night-watches:
my midnight oil burns in the service of your delight.
Do yOU, too, through a long life link together New
Years yet to come, as my page has set in order those
gone by. Even now the example of your father bids
you also win forthwith the purple robe *and join the
company of Ausonian 2 Consuls.

1 The existence of these alternative titles shows that
Ausonius ‘⁶ dedicated” this book twice over, and the fact
that each occurs in one of the two main groups of MSS. has
an important bearing 011 the textual tradition of Ausonius.

See I ntrodecction.
2 The epitheta, of course, bears a double meaning.
