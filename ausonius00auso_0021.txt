INTRODUC-TION

of Ausonius is a long 0116, yet the output, so far as
it can be identified, is small in the extreme3 and
since Ausonius was by no means the man to suppress
anything which he had once written, we may believe
that his professional duties left him little or no
leisure for writing. Some of his extant work, how-
ever, can be identified as belonging to this period.
Possibly his earliest work (since he seems to have
married c. 334 Ap.) is the letter written to his father
On, the Aclmomledgment of leis Son (Epist. xix.)-a
copy of forty elegiacs, very correct but very obvious
and conventional in sentiment. To the first eight
years of this period we must also assign the epigrams
relating to his wife (Epigr. xxxix„ xl„ liii.—lv.>‚ and
those on certain “lascivae nomina famae⁷² (Epz'gr.
xxxviii. and lxxa), which seem to have caused Sabina
some misgiving. It is also probable that a consider-
able number of the remaining epigram—especially
those dealing with academie persons or topics (ag.
Epigr. vi.-xiii., lx„ lxi.)—-were composed during this
period; and it is at least a possible conjecture that
some of the mnemonic verses on the Roman
Calendar, the Greek Games, etc. (ΕΟΖ. ix,-xxvii.)‚ were
written by Ausonius when grammaticus to assist his
pupils at Bordeaux) though worked up for formal
publication at a much later date.
