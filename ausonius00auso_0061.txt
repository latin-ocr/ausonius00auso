PREFATORY PIECES

safe to disoblige a god3 though delay due to
modesty often deserves praise, when we hold back
despite the entreaties of our peers.

1⁷ Nay more, these songs of mine have long been
ready to break out unbidden: and what book would
not be Caesar's own in the hope to escape thereby
the countless erasures of a wretched bard, always
emending and emending for the worse? Remem-
ber only, father of the Romans, that you gave me
the command, and where Ι fail you must bestow

forgiveness on yourself.
