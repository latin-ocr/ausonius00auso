THE MOSELLE

9⁷ Nor shall I pass thee by, O Salmon, with flesh
of rosy red, the random strokes of whose broad tail
from the mid—depths are reproduced upon the sui-face,
when the still water’s face betrays thy hidden course.
Thou, with breastplate of scales, in the fore-part
smooth, and destined to form a course at some
“doubtful dinner,'’1 endurest untainted through
seasons of long delay-thou distinguished by the
markings of thy head, whose generous paunch sways
and whose belly droops with rolls of fat. And thou,
the Eel-pout, who o'er Illyricum, o'er the marshes of
twice-named2 Ister art betrayed and taken through
tell-tale streaks of floating foam, hast been carried to
our waters lest the glad streams of Moselle should be
cheated of so famed a fosterling. With what colours
has Nature painted thee! Above, dark spots pick
out thy back, and rings of saffron surround them3
azure hue continues the length of thy sleek back3
up to the middle of thy length thou art full-fleshed
and fat, but froin there right on to thy tail’s tip, thy
skin is rough and dry.

115 Neither shalt thou, O Perch, the dainty of our
tables, be unsung—thou amongst fishes river-born
worthy to be ranked with the sea-bred, who alone
canst vie on equal terms with the rosy mullet3 for
not insipid is thy flavour, and in thy plump body the
parts meet as segments, but are kept apart by the
backbone. Here, too, doth be, jestingly known by
a Latin proper name—that dweller in the marshes,
most deadly enemy to pl untive flogs— Lucius (the
Pike), beset pools dim with sedgeo and ooze: he
chosen for no selvice at banquets, is f1ied in cook-
shops rank with the fumes of hiso greasy flav.our

² The Ister is also the Danube.
