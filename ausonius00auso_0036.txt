INTRODUCTION

the epigram3 and he conscientiously imitates the
masters of this form of composition in that obscenity
of subject and grossness of expression which, as the
younger Pliny (Epist. lv. xiv. 4 ff, v. iii. l ff.) informs
us, was regarded as essentia] even by the greatest
and most staid worthies.

Rhetoric had a profound effect upon the literary
work of Ausonius. For him a simple statement was
an opportunity (for verbal display) missed3 and no
feature is so characteristic of his poenis as duplica-
tions like

set neque tu viduo longum cruciata sub aevo
protinus optato fine secuta virum.

(Parent. xxx. 9 s.)

More than this, for a necessary word or two Ausonius
loves to substitute an elaborate tom· dejbrce. Thus
in Epist. xvi. 3-14 the simple compl-<tint ‘⁶' you have
not visited me for three months '' is expanded into six
elegIac couplets ; in Epist. xv. 5-35 the word “ thirty ''
is transmuted into as many lines of mixed verse3 in
Epist. xiii. 7-24 it needs eighteen verses adequately
to say ‘·‘ six.'' In another place Ausonius complacently
admits this tendeney, and instead of telling his book
that it is destined for Probus, observes (Jz'pisf. xii. 7 ff.)

possem absolute dicere,

sed dulcius circumloquar

diuque fando perfruar,
—and devotes the next twenty-four lines to a defini-
tion of Probus through his attributes.
