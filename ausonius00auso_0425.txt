A RIDDLE OF THE NUMBER THREE

Three are the squadrons of ,the Knights, three the.
names borne by the nobility.l ‚The chords have
three names,2 and three names each rnonth3 owns.
Geryones was three in one, triple the compound os
Chimaera: Scylla was triple, a mixture of three
forms, part dog, part woman, and part fish. The
Gorgons, Harpies, and Erinyes lived in hands of
three, and three the soothsaying Sibyls,4 bearers of
a common name, whose fateful verses, couched in
volumes three, are preserved in the keeping of the
thrice five men.5

88 Thrice drink! The number three is above all,
Three Persons and one God! And that this con-
ceit may not run its course without significance of
number, let it have verses thrice ten times three, or
nine times ten!

³ i.e. each month cont-ains the three days, Calends, Ν ones,
and Ides.

4 Presumably the Sibyls of Delphi, Cumae, and Erythrae3
but many other Sibyls were known.

⁵ The Sibylline books were first in the charge of Duum-
viri, then of Decemviri, and (from the first century B.C.)
of Quindecimviri.
