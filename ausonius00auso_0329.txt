THE ORDER OF FAMOUS CITIES

VIL—MILAN

AT Milan also are all things wonderful, abundant
wealth, countless stately houses, men able, eloquent,
and cheerfully disposed3 besides, there is the grandeur
of the site enlarged by a double wall,1 the Circus,
her people's joy, the massy enclosed Theatre with
wedge-like blocks of seats, the temples, the imperial
citadels, the wealthy Mint, and the quarter renowned
under the title of the Baths of Herculeus;2 her
colonnades all adorned with marble statuary, her
walls piled like an earthen rampart round the city's
edge z—all these, as it were rivals in the vast masses
of their workmanship, are passing grand3 nor does
the near neighbourhood of Rome abase them.

VIII.—CAPUA

Noa, certes, shall I leave unsung Capua, mighty in
tillage of fields and in fruits, in luxury, in wealth,
and in earlier renown, who, despite Fortune's chang-
ing haps, relied on her prosperity and knew not how
to keep the mean. Now she, once rival, is subject
to Rome3 now she keeps faith, once 1311111633-
when, at a stand whether to flout or court the
Senate, 3116 dared to hope for magistrates chosen
under Campanian auspices, and that with one consul
from among her sons she might take up the empire

2 Or possibly “of HerculeS.³⁷ In either case the epithet
indicates that the Baths were built by or under Maximian,
surnamed Herculeus, who according to Aurelius Victor (Caes.
xxxix. 45) adorned Milan with many fine buildings. To the
same Emperor also the Palatinae arces, or imperial resfflence,
is to be ascribed.
