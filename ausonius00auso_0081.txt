THE DAILY ROUND

34 Away, you evil dreams, through the sloping
firmaments of heaven, where wandering storms
scatter the still-vexed clouds; dwell in the moon-lit
Skies. Why steal you in at my doors and haunt the
darkling couch in my confined dwelling? Leave
me 'co pass night unexeited in calm repose till golden
Lucifer comes back for me in the rosy east. But if
soft sleep shall soothe me with his gentle breath,
nor any shapes trouble my rest by night, this grove
—the elm which spreads its green leaves on my
estate—I dedic-ate for you to dwell in on your night
watches.
