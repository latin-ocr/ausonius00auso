YoUNG Janus, who givest thy name to the first
month of the year, twy-faced Janus, thou dost be-
hold two seasons at one time. After worship of
the gods, Numa ordains Februa in the next month,
a feast of offerings to the shades of kinsfolk.
Martian, leader both of the Roman race and year,
thou wast wont to bring in the beginning of the
Latin consulate. Mother of the sons of Aeneas, thou,
Venus, givest thy name to April, the month which
follows next; for Aphrodite keeps Mars company.
l am in doubt whether the goddess Maia or genera-
tions passed (maiores) named thee May, but either
is a good patron for a month. June follows next
with double title to renown, whether it was Juno
or Juventa who lent her name. Then J uly, brilliant
with Dione’s star,l occupies the fixed season of mid-
summer. Augustus' month follows that named after
his kinsman Julius, next in the year's order even
as he in race. Next comes a string of months
marked by successive numbers: September, who
soaks the presses with Bacchus' gift3 October, glad-
dened with the seasons' usury for seedling grain, who
flatters the grasping sarmer's hopes3 November,
who casts headlong her appointed stars, and plunges
them in the brine, soon to return to heaven their
home. December closes the list and ends our 011661·-
ful feasts, that from winter a new year may presently
go forth.
