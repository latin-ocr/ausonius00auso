THE MOSELLE

A LETTER OF SYMMACHUS TO AUSONIUS

SYMMACHUS To Ausons

ΤΗΑΤ you ask me to send you a longer letter is a
proof of the reality of your affectionzfor me. But Ι 3111
30 fully aware of the poverty of my natural equip-
ment that I think it better to cultivate a Spartan
brevity than to expose my starved and stunted faculty
of expression by adding page to page. And it is no

heavy usury in the matter of words, when you have
advaneed me no loan in the shape of literary work?
Your Moselle—that poem which has immortalized a

to deny me part or lot in that little book? You
thought 1116 either too uncultivated to be able to
appreciate it, or at all events too grudging to praise
it, and thereby have offered the greatest possible
affront to my head or to my beart, as the case may
be. However, despite your ban I have penetrated
with difficulty to the sanctuary of that work. I
should like to withhold my opinion, I should like
to take 3 fair revenge on you by saying nothing3
but my admiration for the work breaks down my
sense of wrong.

I know that river from of old when I was on
the staff of the immortal Emperors: ’tis a match
for many though no match for the greatest. And
