INTRODUCTION

This theory cannot be upheld. The poenis common
to Z and V frequently differ so markedly that the
variants cannot possibly be attributed to the fortunes
of the MSS. The Epic-eddon may be cited first in
illustration. Here Z omits the 161111113, 11. 13-11ἱ,
19-26 (all found in If), and in l. 38 reads “gnatos
tris numero genui '' (for “ gnatos quattuor edidimus ''
of V ), omitting further ll. 39-40.

111 the Epitaphia the same phenomena occur: in
xxxi. 1 Ζ reads “ et odoro perlue nardo” for the
‘⁶ bene olentis et unguine nardi '' of V3 and in 1. 6 Ζ
1135 “ felix seu memini sive nihil memini '' 35 against
the “seu meminisse putes 01111113, sive nihil'' of l'.
And in xxxii. 1 Z gives “ Lucius: una quidem
geminis sed dissita punctis '’ for Ῑ”5 ‘·' una quidem,
geminis fulget set dissita punctis.’' In xxxv. ἶ)
we find “Quis mortem accuset? Complevit munia
vitae ” (Z) and ‘⁶ Quis mortem accuset? Quis 11011
accuset in ista'’ (l).

An example of another kind is afforded by the
Oratio (Eplzemeris iii.). In Z this is an independent
poem, in V it is embodied as 311 episode in the
Dscz'lgs Romu& and further the text shows more than
accidental changes. In l. 1 Ζ has “ Omnipotens,
quem mente 0010, pater unice rerum ’' : V, “ Omnipo-
tens, solo mentis mihi cognite cultu”; ll. 8-16
are found 111 V but not in Z; and in l. 84 Z reads
“ Consona quem celebrat modulato carmine plebeS,'’
but V, “ C. q. celebr-ant modulati carmina David.'’

So, too, in the Fasti. The initial poem 15 addressed
