V.-A SOLEMN PRAYER OF AUsoNqu As CONSUL-Desm-
NATE, WHEN HE ASSUMED THE INSIGNIA or Ornoi:
oN THE Evss OF THE KALENDS oF JANUARY

Come, Jamts ; come, Nem Year ,· come, Sem, with

strength renewed !

soon to behold Ausonius enthroned in state, consul
of Rome. What hast thou now beneath the Imperial
dignity itself to marvel at? Tha’c famous Rome, 'chat
dwelling of Quirinus, and ’chat Senate whose bordered
robes glow with rich purple, from this point date
their seasons in 'their deathless reeords.

Come, lanus ,· come, Nem Year,· come, San, with
strength rene-med !

1⁰ Year, that beginnes’c with good augury, give us
in healthful Spring winds of sunny breath ; when 'che
Crab shows at ’che solstice, give us dews, and allay the
hours of September with a cooi north wind. Let
shrewdly-biting frosts lead in Autumn and let Sum-
mer wane and yield her place by slow degrees. Let
the south winds moisten the seed corn, and Winter
reign with all her snows until March, father of the
old-style year,1 come back anew.

Come, ιῘαηιι.ς·,· come, Nem Year; come, Suu, with
strength renewed !

13 Lei: May come back with new grace and fragrant
breath of flowers, let July ripen crops and give the
sea respite from eastern winds, le'c Sirius’ flames
not swell the heat of Leo's rage, let party-hued
Pomona bring on array of luscious frusts, let Autumn

Ronths (J anuary and February) was traditionally ascribed to
uma.
