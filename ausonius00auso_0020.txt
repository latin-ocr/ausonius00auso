INTRODUCTION

F urther, the conception of the Deity held by
Ausonius was distinctly peculiar——as his less guarded
references show. ln the Easter Verses (Domest. ii. 24 ff.)
the Trinity is a power transcending but not unlike
the three Emperors3 and in the Griphus (l. 88) the
“ tris deus unus '’ is advanced to enforce the maxim
“ter bibe '' in exactly the same tone as thatin which
the children of Rhea, or the three Gorgons are
cited: for our author the Christian Deity was not
essentially different from the old pagan gods.

There is a marked contrast, therefore, between
Ausonius’ formal professions and his actual beliefs.
This is not to accuse him of hypocrisy. Conventional
by nature, he accepted Christianity as the established
religion, becoming a half-believer in his casual
creed : it is not in the least likely that he ever set
himself to realize either Christianity or Paganism.

THE LlTssnAm· Wonk oF AUsons

The adult life of Ausonius may be divided into
three periodS: the first, extending from c. 334 to 364
A.D., covers the thirty years of professorial work at
Bordeaux3 the second (c. 364-383) includes the
years spent first as Gratian's tutor and then as his
minister3 while the last ten <years of his life con- ’
stitute the third. His circumstances during each of
these periods necessarily affected his literary work5
which may therefore be correspondingly divided.
