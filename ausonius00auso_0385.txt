THE MASQUE OF THE SEVEN SAGES

well or ill—so Terence the comedian declares—every
one should take careful thought. When you want
to let a house, to carry on war or to end it, to tran-
sact affairs of great, less, or least importzznce, you
always ought to think carefully. For in new enter-
prises everyone makes slow progress if cai-esu] thought
is wanting to his action. There is nothing which can
demand greater attention than to think what ought
to be done. Therefore 'tis chance, not design, which
governs the unreflecting.

229 But now I must rejoin my fellow—characters.
AppLaud, and take thought while you manage your
state affairs.
