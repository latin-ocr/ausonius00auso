THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

to tell that you became a grammarian in your youth,
but even this was then so slight that it no longer
lingers now. Yet, be you who you were, because
you lived and taught in my lifetime‚ take this my
offering, “ farewell ! ''

XIIL—-To C1TAR1US, THE SICILIAN oF Svmxcusu,
GREEK GRAMMARIAN AT Boaomux

YoU also shall be recalled by me, beloved Citarius,
for you deserve to be praised amongst good gram-
marians. If the custom of past ages still obtained,
you would have the renown of Aristarchus and
Zenodotus among the Greeks. Even 'che Muse of
Simonides of Ceos yields place to the odes which
you composed in your early years. Born in a Sicilian
town, you came a stranger to our city, but quickly
made it 'che home of culture with your learning.
Here you soon found a wife well-born and rich3 but
Fate grudged you the gift of children ere your
death. But, now that you are gone, we honour you
with the tribute of our remembrance, even as we
cheered you, while you lived, with the gift of our
friendship.

XIV.-—To CENsotuus A‘r'r1cus Aomcms,
THE RHETORICIAN

Fon mastery in eloquence worthy to be ranked
equal with the foremost, here, Agricius, you have
been set in a lower place : since you were born and
died in later years,I had delayed to mention you,
yet had not also forgotten you. But be your place
where it may, my sad lanient shall recall your
memory: early or late, homage paid to the dead
