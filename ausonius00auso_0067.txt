THE DAILY ROUND

[IL—THE PRAYER

ALM1GHTY One, whom through the worship of my
heart alone I know, to the wicked unknown, yet
known to every devout soul, thou art without be-
ginning and without end, more ancient than time
past and time to come: thy fashion and extent no
mind can ever grasp, nor tongue express. He only
may behold thee and, face to face, hear thy bidding
and sit at thy fatherly right-hand who is himself the
Maker of all things, himself the Cause of all created
things, himself the Word of God, the Word which
is God, who was before the world which he was to
make, begotten at that time when Time was not yet,
who came into being before the Sun's beams and the
bright Morning—Star enlightened the sky. Without
him was nothing made, and through him were all
things made t his throne is in Heaven3 and beneath
his seat lie Earth and the Sea and the invincible
Chaos of darkling Night: uni-esting, he is the very
mover of all things, the quickener of the lifeless.
He is God, the begotten of the unbegotten, who
being provoked by the guile of his scornful people,
called the nations into his kingdom—the worthier
offshoots of an ingrafted stock to worship him. To
our forefathers it was granted to behold him3 and
whoso discerned his Godhead, to him it was given to
have seen the F ather also. He bare our sinful stains
and suffered a death with mockery, thus teach-
ing us that there is a road to lead back to eternal
life, and that the soul returns not alone, but with
the body complete enters the realms of Heaven
and leaves the secret chamber of the grave empty,
covered with earth which cannot hold it.
