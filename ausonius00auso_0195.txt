EPITAPHS

11.—F01³ MENELAus ¹

O HAPPY Menelaus, who hast the allotted dwelling-
place of gods,2 and Elysium, ordained for pious souls !
Beloved of Tyndareus, beloved of the Thunderer as
their sm1-i11-law‚3 champion of wedlock, avenger of
adustery, strong in unending life, unending youth,
you have endured no day of death, 110 day of eld.

HL—Fon AJAx 4

AT Ajax' tomb Ι, Valour, lie o'erwhelined along
with him. Here, over the mound which marks my
obsequies, Ι weep with hair all torn and towsled‚
because the mean son of Atreus forced me to yield
to his calculated wiles. Now will I make to spring
from this noble blood a ruddy flower 5 that with a word
of woe bears witness to that unrighteous judgment.6

1V.—F0ss ACHILLES

NoT one the land which holds the son of Aeacus:
his bones are buried on the Sigean shore, and at
Larissa were his tresses burned. Part of him lies
hidden in the tomb, part was borne home by the fleet 3
but in the whole world Homer shall show him living
once again.
