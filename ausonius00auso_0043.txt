INTRODUCTION

In the fourth century, therefore, there were current
(a) early or “adrance '' copies of individual workS,
(b) formally published copies of the same, possibly
containing small iuiprovenients, (c) three “ collected '’
editions of the works. that is the relation between
these possible sources and the extant MSS? We
may say at once that there is no means of determin-
uunghether our BISS.are to an3*extent‹iependent
upon essffnn·the“advancc''copstss or the pubhshed
editions of single works3 and it is tolerably certain
that the collected edition prepared for Theodosius is
rn)longer extant and pnssxssssy uas never avassabkz
to the public. It is apparently from the collected
edifflons of 383 enni 393 Ain that the survhdng
MSS. are derived. These MSS. are classified in four
groups: (l) The Z or Tilianus group‚ represented
by the Codex Tilianus (Leidensis Vossianus lat.
Q. 107). The numerous MSS. of this class all present
the same works in the same order and contain no poem
assignable to a date later than 383 A.D. (2) The Γ
group, a single MS. of the ninth century (Leidensis
Vossianus lat. lll) containing for the most part the
poeffs later ivorks and “rennnns'⁷ together ·udth
second editions of some earlier poems, and some
nuoeefial(ag.the(Efflphusandthe [bn w Pumfiahm)in
the same shape which it wears in the Z group. (3)
The Pgroup‚ represented by Parisinus 8:300, contain-
ing selections. (4) The Eafeerpls (so called from the
title of the MSS), a further series of extracts.
