INTRODUCTION

Proffrepticw.s· (Epist. xxii.), an exhortation addressed to
the poet's grandson and namesake.

W e have seen that Ausonius returned from
Aquitaine to Treves somewhere between :380 and
353 A.D. It was perhaps during these years that he
wrote the Cupio} Crucified, the subject of which was
suggested by a wall-painting at Treves.

In 383 A.D. Maximus seized the Empire of the
West, and Ausonius' pupilj Gratiam, was done to
death. The poet, as we have seen, was possibly
detained for a while at Treves3 and the revolution
seems to have profoundly affected him. A fragment
(Epist. xx.) written at this period clearly shows the
gloom and foreboding which had settled upon his
spirits, and possibly checked for a time the flow of
his poetic vein. Nevertheless, in or after 385 ΑΛ). a
noteworthy group of works was completed and
published. The first of these, indeed, the Parentalia,
was written at intervals (eg. iv. 31 e. 379, and
xxiv. ὅ, 16 in 382 A.D.) and may have been
actually finished in 3823 but the preface to the
Professores indicates that the two works were issued
together.1 The Parentalia is a collection of thirty
poenis, mostly in eleoiacs, celebrating the memory
of the author's deceased relatives. VVhether super-
stition or mere love of verse-making be the cause,
even remote connections whom the poet had hardly
or never met are duly commemorated (Parent. xxi.

ll Unless this preface belongs to the Collected Edition
