PARENTALIA

You, my mother’s brother, and one in soul with my
father, and to me who were as my father and my
mother, who in my infancy, boyhood, youth, and
manhood, instructed me in arts which it is a delight
to have learned—you the learned gownsmen oi
Toulouse, that home of Pallas, made their chief,
you Gaul of Narbonne—a province whose tribunal
you enriched with Roman eloquence, as also the
courts of Spain and Novempopulonia.l Hence your
fame was spread all over Europe, until Constanti-
nople claimed you as its professor and flourished
under your instruction. It was you, skilled and
eloquent of speech through all its countless devices,
through all its countless utterances of majesty; you,
quick of wit and sure of memory3 you who, when
in my earliest years I was committed to your charge
and pleased you well, said you needed nothing more
since I was in the world. And when you avowed
that Ι was a glory,I an honour to you and to my
parents, you dictated words to be entered in the
book of my destiny.

23 And so farewell, my uncle, in the Elysian abode
appointed you : Ι make this offering of verse to you
from the cup of your own Muses.

Foasmffl not your sacred task, my duteous page:
next after these let me celebrate the memory
of my mother's father, Arborius who derived his
name from a line of Aeduan ancestors, uniting the
blood of many a noble house, both of the province
of Lyons, and of that land where the Aedui held
sway, and in the country of Vienne bordered by

1 A province in the “ diocese '’ of Vienne.
