A RIDDLE OF THE NUMBER THREE

do in defending 11²..st 611, this trumpery booklet, long
since mangled by its surreptitious but wide 61161113-
tion, will ab last come into 50111· hands. You will
either, like Aesculapius,1 restore it to life, or, like
Ρ13ῒο,2 'with aid of Vulcan,3 will deliver i'c from
disrepute‚ if it has no right ’co attain 'co repnte.
The occasion of this bit of foolery was 35 follows.
When Ι was on active service 4———a season which, as
you know, is one of military freedom—a’c my mess a
challenge was issued to drink‚ not in Greek fashion 5
as a’c the banquet of Rubrius, but after the manner
described by Flaccus in that piece of his where by
reason of “midnight'' and the ‘⁶ new moon'' and
“ Muraena's augurship '' “the bard inspired calls for
thrice three cups.'' At this subject of 'che triple
number that poetic itch of mine at once began
scratching away: and since this disease is easily
communic-able, may the plaguy passion pass over
to you also, and that, with some of your improving
colour added, you may dash the sponge which shall
give the finishing touch to 'che incomplete work
of my badly-foaming Pegasus.⁶ And ’chat you may
know me for a boaster-—I began these bits of verses

5 Asconius cominente on Cicero, 2771 Vew. 11. i. 26. ‘Now
the Greek fashion is, 35 the Greeks express it, ‘to drink
together cup for cup, ’when they make ofiering of unmixed
wine from their cups, first saluting uhe gods and then naming
their own friends3f01 as often as they call by name upon
the gods and those dear to them, so often do they drink
unmixecl wine.

⁶ The third· centul) painter Nealces, dis <satisfied with his
rendering of 3 foaming horse, began to apply 3 sponge tvo
delete his work, but found that the first touch had produced
the eflect he 113(1 vainly laboured to attain: see Ρ11115, N. H.
xxxv. 10, §104 (ed. Ma3hoff). Almost the 531116 story 15
