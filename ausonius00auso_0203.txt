NASTES and Amphimachus, N omion‘s famous seed,l
once champions, we are dust and shades.

XVIII.-F0n Tno'iLUs

THoUGH Hector was laid low, and though 111
strength of arm and heavenly aid ill-matched, l,
Tio'ilus, met the fieice son of Aeacus face to face,
and, dragged to death b) my own 31ῑ66ᾶ3,2 3111 linked
in glory with 11111 biother, 11 hose example made mv
sufferings light

XIX—Fon Pomnoaus

BEGoNE far hence, unconscious stranger, and avoid
that myrtle-tree : 'tis grown from darts and nourished
with my blood. Pierced through with spears and
almost buried in 11111 very slaying‚ Ι, Polydorus, lie
twice intemed beneath this mound. Pious Α6116333
knows 1111 310111, and you also, impious king3 foi as
it 1133 Thracian cruelty that clushed 1116, 30 it 1133
Trojan piety that buried me.

XX.———Fon EUPHEMUS

Eupnmus, leader of the Cicones, was laid 111
Trojan soil hard by the statue of spear—bearing Mars,
No epitaph graven on his tombstone suffices, but

monuments fall the sooner which are heaped up so
high, and where magnificence is too great, great
ruin lurks beneath.
