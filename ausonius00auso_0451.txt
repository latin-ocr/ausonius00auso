APPENDIX

THE puzzle here described in the Preface to the Cento
(p. 374) is the loculus Archemedffls, of which Caesius
Bassus (de lustris, p. 271, ed. Keil) gives the following
account: “loculus ille Archemedius qui quattuordecim
eboreas lamellas, quarum varii anguli sunt, in quadratam
formam inclusas habet, componentibus nobis aliter atque
aliter modo galeam, niodo sicam, alias columnam, alias
navem figurat et innumerabiles efficit species.” Marius
Victorinus (Ars Gramm. iii. 1, pp. 100 f.‚ ed. Keil) also
describes the loculus as consisting of fourteen pieces,
“nunc quadratis, nunc triangulis, nuno ex utraque
specie.”¹ The puzzle, then, consisted in a rectangle
divided up into fourteen triangular or quadrilateral
figures.

From another source we learn the principle on Which
this division was effected. There is extant in Arabio ² a
work entitled “The book of Archimedes on the division
of the figure Stomaschionss into fourteen figures which
stand in direct ratio to it” (sc. the whole). The method
of division there set forth is as follows ε

Take a parallelogram ABGD (F ig. 1) and bisect BG
at E. From E draw EZ at right angles to BG, and also

 

1 The poem of Ennodius‚ cle ostomachio Eburneo (Carm. ii.
133, ed Hartel) is not- enlightening.

² A fragmentary and incomplete Greek text (from a
paliinpsest MS.) is also extant: both are given by Heiberg
in his second edition of Archimedes’ works (Teubner, 1913),
11.3p'F.hglgg·bic is unpointed, and the vowels therefore un-
certain : the Greek title is Στομάχιον ; but the form Ὀστομοί-
χιον is certainly right.
