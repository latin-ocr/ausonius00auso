THE ORDER OF FAMOUS CITIES

XIX.-NAnssoNNE

N on shalt thou be unsung, Martian 1 Narbonne, who
gav'st thy name to that Provinoe (Provence) which
once spread over a vast realm and held sovereign
sway over its numerous inhabitants. Where the
Allobroges encroach upon the Graian borders and
Alpine peaks shut out Italy, where the Iberians are
parted from thee by Pyrenaean snows, where Rhone
sweeps headlong from his sire Leman, and the
Cevennes thrust deep into the plains of Aquitaine,
right on to the Teutosagi and Belcae,2 rustic folk‚
—all was Narbonne: thou in all Gaul wast first to
display the insignia of the Roman race under an
Italian proconsul.3

¹2 What shall I say of thy harbours, mountains,
lakes? What of thy peoples with their varied differ-
ences of garb and speech? Or of the temple of
Parian marble, once thine, so vast in bulk that old
Tarquin, the first builde1·,4 would not scorn it, nor
Catulus5 the second, nor he who last raised the
golden roofs of the Capitol, Caesar himself? 6 Thee
the merchandise of the eastern sea and Spanish
main enrich, thee the fleets of the Libyan and Sicilian
deeps, and all freights which pass by many different
routes o’er rivers and o’er seas: the whole world
over no argosy is afloat but for thy sake.
