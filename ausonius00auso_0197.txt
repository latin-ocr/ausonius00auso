EPITAPHS

VL-Foa DioMEDEs 1

HERE lies buried Diomedes, nobler son of a noble
father³ banished through his wife's sin 2 from Argos,
the city of her dowry, who founded Argyripa and
Arpi,3 famed for heroes, and gained greater fame
from his new city than from the ancient seat
whence he was sprung.

VIL-Fon ANTILOCHUS 4

Goon both in council and in field—rare is the
union-and deal· to the sons of Atreus and of Aeacus
alike, I am that Antilochus who died to gain the
double meed of valour and of piety in saving my
father, Nestor. Such was not Nature’s order3 yet
it was fittei· that he survived without whom false
Troy could not be taken.

· VIlI.-—F01z NEsTou 5

ΗΕΒΕ in this tomb I lie, my fourth lifetime wholly
spent at last, Nestor, famed for wisdom and for elo-
quence. To save me from death, my son exposed
himself and died; and it was by my son's wounds I
lived. Alas, why was it Fate's pleasure so to order
our lives, giving me so long, giving Antilochus so
short a span?
