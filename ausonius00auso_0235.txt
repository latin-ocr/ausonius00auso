l represents the Sign in which the Sun stands at the
moment of conception. Starting from here, the Suu's pass-
age through 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ll forms an equal-sided hexagon ;
through 1, 4, 7, 10, a square ; through l, 5, 9, an equilateral
triangle. 1-4 and 1-10 therefore are lines of quadrilateral
aspect ; 1-5 and 1-9, of triangular aspect. The diameter of
the zodiacal circle, 1—7, is the line of direct aspect. 1-6 and
1-8 cannot form the sides of any equilateral figure within the
circle ; while 1-2 and 1-1‘2 barely constitute aspects.
