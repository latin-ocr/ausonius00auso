THE DAILY ROUND

THE DOINGS OF A WHOLE DAY

ALREADY bright Morn is opening her windows,
already the watchful swallow twitters from her nest3
but yon, Parmeno, sleep on as if it were the first or
the middle wateh of the night. Dormice sleep the
winter round, but they leave food alone3 while you
slumber on because you drink deep, and swell out
your paunch with too great a mass of food. And
so no sound enters the winding channels of your
ears, a deep stupor presses on your consciousness,
and all the dazzling beams of light do not vex your
eyes. Old tales pretend that once upon a time a
youth 1 slept on year in, year out, untroubled by the
interchange of night and day, because Luna made
his slumbers unending.
