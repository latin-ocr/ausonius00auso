INTRODUCTION

Tm: works of Ausonius were held in high esteem
by the poet’s contemporaries: Symmachus protests
that he classes the Dffosella as equal with the poems
of virgil, and Paulinus of Nola has grave doubts as
to whether ‘⁶ Tully and Maro '' could have borne one
yoke with his old master. Extravagant as such judg-
ments may be,1 they have their value as indicating
wherein (from the modern point of view) the import-
ance of Ausonius really lies. As poetry, in any high
or imaginative sense of the word, the great mass of
his verse is negligible3 but the fact that in the later
fourth century men of letters and of affairs thought
otherwise, establishes it as an example and criterion
of the literary culture of that age. The poenis of
Ausonius are in fact a series of documents from which
we may gather in what poetry was then assumed to
consist, what were the conditions which determined
its character, and the models which influenced it.

In a definite sense, therefore, the chief value of
the works of Ausonius is historical ; but not for the
history of intellectual culture alone. The poet does
not, indeed, throw light on the economic fabric of

Bury, 111. p. 134 note 1).
