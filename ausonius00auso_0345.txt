THE TECHNOPAEGNION

smaller. In composing them, if it is a question of
utility, Ι have been at play: if of trouble, I have
been hard at work. I have called this little book
Technopaegniwz, that you might not think it has been

31le l{vork without play for me, or all play without

IL-—Ausons To His FmEND piramus

Ι AM sending you my T ecknopaegnion, the poor un-
profitable outcome of inactive leisure. It consists in
verses begun with monosyllables and ended with
monosyllables. But the roek-strewnl difficulty of the
task did not stop there, but went on further to the
beart-breaking business of linking up, so that the
monosyllable which was the ending of one verse
might also become the beginning of the line follow-
ing. You may well exelaim, then : “ Heavens, what
time and toil ἱ ’' Of a surety Ι have spent my pains
upon a useless task : it is small, yet it brings a sense
of surfeit3 it is disjointed, yet a hopeless tangle3
though it is something, it is proved to be worth just
nothing. Nevertheless, I have taken pains to give
it something of learning and lore3 for the rule I
was bound to keep debarred the lighter graces of
poetry and rhetoric. To sum up, you will find here
nothing pretty, but (with the change of a few letters)
something to pity and to resolve never to imitate.
And if you should come down into these depths also,
you will find the eramping of your ideas and powers
of expression causes you greater discomfort than your
effort at imitation affords you delight.
