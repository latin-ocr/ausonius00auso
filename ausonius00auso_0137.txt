PARENTALIA

whole house alone. Alas! Too young, yet happy
that her husband and her son still lived, she met
her final doom and died. She was of one heart
and one in blood with my Sabina, and by me was
she called sister unreproved. Now also my loving
thoughts busy themselves with her peaceful shade,
and voice these words of tribute to my Pudentilla.

XX.-—LucANus TAL1sms, Tama SoN

Yon, too, in turn shall not pass unregarded, young
Talisius, my nephew and your mother's only hope.
Though you were snatched from us in the first years
of your prime, yet you were already wed, already
early made a father: and we may think Fate
hastened that event, that being so quickly made a
grandfather, your own sire might not declare your
death to be untimely.

XXI.—-ATTUS1A LUCANA TALISIA AND MlNuqus
REGULUS, MY SISTER AND BnoTuEa-m-LAW

THoUGH slight was my acquaintance with you, At-
tusia, and though I had none at all with him who
was your husband, yet you are own sister of my wife
Sabina, and you also, Regulus, rank as my brother-in-
· law. Wherefore, since ye have names which are so
dear to me, let me touch you with the homage of
my sorrowing verse. For although ye be buried far
Ἰ from here in the soil of Saintes, yet the last homage

can find its way to the souls of the departed.
