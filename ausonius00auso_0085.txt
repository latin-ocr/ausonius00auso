PERSONAL POEMS

his gold abroad in the midst of the Syrtes, all Lydia
turned to gold cannot content a Midas. The man
who sets no bounds to his greed, sets 110116 10 1115
possessions: that is the limit to wealth, which you
decree in your own soul.

1⁷ But now you must know of what size is this
estate of mine, that you may also know me and know
yourself too, if you are capable. And yet how difficult
11115 15, 10 know oneself! KNow TmsELF: as hastily h
as we lead that motto, so quickly 116 forget it. Ι
keep 1n tillage two hund] ed acres: a hundred mole
are grown 111111 1711165, and half as much is pasture.
My woodland is more than twice as much as my
pasture, vineyard and tilth together : of husbandmen
1 have neither too many nor too few. A spring is
near my house and 3 5111311 well, besides the unsullied
river, which on its tides bears me by boat from home
and back again. Ι have always fruits in store 10 1351
1116 two whole years: who has short victual by him,
he too has famine at hand.l

29 This my estate 1165 1101 far from the town, nor
yet hard by the town, to rid me of its crowds 11711116
reaping its advantages. And 50, whenever satiety
moves me to change my seat, I pass from 0116 10
the other, and enjoy country and town by turns.

11.—EAsmn VERSES Composmn roa THE EMPEROR

Now return the holy 11165 of Christ, who brought
us our salvation, and godly zealots keep their solemn
fasts. But we, guarding within our hearts an unend-
ing worship, maintain without a break the strength
of an inviolate homage: rites are observed once a
year3 but our devotion is continual.
