THE ECLOGUES

VIII.—ON THE NAMEs OF THE SEvEN DAYs

THE names borne by the seven days recurring
throughout the year, 316 given by as many planets‚
which the firmament rolls along in unwearied revolu-
tions, bidding them roam amid the stars which stand
athwart them. The first day and the last the ray-
crowned Sun holds for his own. The Moon next
succeeds to her brother's crown. Mars, following
these Titan lights, is counted third. Mercury claims
for his own the stars of the fourth day. The golden
star of Jupiter illumines the fifth zone3 and in the
sixth place kindly Venus follows the health—bringing
father of the gods. The seventh day is Saturn’s, and
0011163 1331 of all 3 for on the eighth the circling orbit
restores the Sun once more.
