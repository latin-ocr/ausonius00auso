translator, and subsequently to the difficulty oi
introducing a radically new system in a series of this
nature, the text of the present edition is Peiper's
(Teubner, Leipzig, 1886), in which (l) the two
distinct collections were thrown into one and the
resultant mass rearranged according to the Editor's
notion of what was plausible ; (2) the two recensions
of individua] works were fused together confound-
ing the two series. As a result Ausonius' literary
methods are somewhat obscured3 but the fact that
the order of the “ opuscula '’ is without significance,
makes this disadvantage less serious.
