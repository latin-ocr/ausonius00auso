A NUPTIAL CENTO

aridaque ora quatit, sudor fluit undique rivis,
labitur exanguis, destillat ab inguine virus.

Be satisfied, friend Paul,
Paul, with this naughty page ε
Laughter—naught else—I ask.

But when you have done reading, stand by me to
face those who, as Juvenal says—

“ Put on the airs of Curius and live like Bacchanals,'’

lest perchanee they picture my life in colours of my
poem.

“ My page is naughty, but my life is clean‚'’

as Martia] says. But let them remember, learned as
they are, that Pliny, a most honourable man, shows
looseness in his sei-aps of verse, rigour in his private
life3 that Sulpicia'sl little work is wauton, her out-
look prim; that in morals Apuleius was a philosopher,
iu his epigrams a lover3 that iu the precepts of Cicero
strictness is prominent, in his letters to Caerellia2
lieenee lurks; that Plato’s §anepos-ium contains rhap-
sodies upon favourites. For what shall I say of the
Fescennine verses of Annianus,3 what of the volumes
of the Jeu (l’Amour of Laevius,4 that most ancient
poet? What of Evenus‚⁵ whom Menander has called

'¹³ Annianus flourished under Trajan and Hadrian: cp.
Aulus Gellius, vii. 7.

‘² Laevius, author of erotie poeuis burlesquing mythologieal
subjects, flourished at the beginning of the first century n.(;.:
see Teuffel-Schwabe, His-t. of Roman Lit. (trans. lYarre),
ἓ 150.

⁵ Evenus of Paros, a writer of erotie verse, probably be-
longs to the fourth century 13.(:.: he is to be distinguished
from a fifth-century namesake, also of Paros.
