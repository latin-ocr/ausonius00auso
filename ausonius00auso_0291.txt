THE MOSELLE

125 Who shall not know of the green Teneh also,
the comfort of the commons, of Bleak, a prey for
boyish hooks, of Shad, hissing on the hearth, food
for the vulgar, and of thee, something between two
species, who art neither and yet both, not yet
salmon, no longer trout, and undefined betwixt these
twain, art caught midway in thy life? Thou also
must be mentione-d amid the battalions of the stream,
Gudgeon, no longer than the width of two palms
without the thumbs, full-fat, rounded, and yet more
bulky when thy belly teems with spawn—-Gudgeon,
who art bearded like the tufted barbel.

135 Now, creature of the surface, shall thy praise
be sung, O mighty Sheat-fish, whom, with back
glistening as though with olive-oi] of Attica} I look
on as a dolphin of the river—so mightily thou glidest
through the waters and canst scal-ee extend thy
trailing body to its full length, hampered by shallows
or by river-weeds. But when thou urgest thy peace-
ful course in the stream, at thee the green banks
marvel, at thee the azure throng of the finny tribe,
at thee the limpid waters: in the ehannel a tide is
rolled abroad on either hand, and the ends of the
waves drive onward at the marge. So, when at
times on the Atlantie deep a whale by wind or his
own motion is driven to the verge of land, the sea
displaced o'erflows, great waters rise, and neigh-
bouring mountains fear to lose their height. Yet
this—this gentle whale of our Moselle is far from
havoc and brings glory to the mighty stream.

15⁰ Now 'tis enough to have viewed the watery
paths and to have told o'er the fishes in their glist-
ening hosts and legions manifold. Let show of vines
lead on another pageant, and let Bacch us’ gifts attraet
