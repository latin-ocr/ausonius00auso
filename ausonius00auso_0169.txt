THE PROFESSORS OF BORDEAUX

42 For Anastasius also shape a mournful lay, my
Muse3 and you, my dirge, recall that poor gram-
marian. He was born at BordeaUX, but ambition
transferred him to Poictiers. There he lived a poor
man, Stinted alike in food and dress, and in his old
age lost the faint glimmer of renown which his country
and his chair had shed on him. Howbeit, I have
here paid a tribute to his name, that the tonib should
not swallow up his name with his bones.

HERCULANUS, though you came from my bosom and
my class, you have repaid your uncle with promise
rather than with fruit. You shared in the work of
my class, and might have succeeded to my chair‚ had
not the swerving steps of slippery youth caused you
to fall headlong‚ through not keeping to the right
path traced out by Pythagoras.1 May you have rest,
and may your spirit dwell in peace in its last home——
you whose name I recalled a while ago amongst my
1·elatives.‘2

XIL-To THALAssUs, LA'rlN GRAMMARL-xx 01³

OF your rank and name, Thalassus, youthful
teacher, I heard as a little boy, scarce even do Ι
recall them. Of your person or attainments, of the
family whence you were sprung, a later age pro-
claims nought concerning you. Only report used
paths of Vice and Virtue. It is in youth that a man must

make his choioe between these two ‹livergent ways.
